In this paper, we extend the hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, and propose a novel model, called Class-K HMRF model, to further improve the segmentation accuracy by incorporating more contextual information during classification. This model simultaneously takes account of spatial dependencies between image pixels and bias field, and hence can overcome the difficulties caused by noise and intensity inhomogeneity. By comparing our algorithm with state-of-the-art approaches, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can produce more accurate and reliable segmentations."}
