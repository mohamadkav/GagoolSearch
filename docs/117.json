{"id":117,"title":"The CMU Pose, Illumination, and Expression Database","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3193633_The_CMU_Pose_Illumination_and_Expression_Database","abstraction":"In the Fall of 2000, we collected a database of more than 40,000 facial images of 68 people. Using the Carnegie Mellon University 3D Room, we imaged each person across 13 different poses, under 43 different illumination conditions, and with four different expressions. We call this the CMU pose, illumination, and expression (PIE) database. We describe the imaging hardware, the collection procedure, the organization of the images, several possible uses, and how to obtain the database."}
