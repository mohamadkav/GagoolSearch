{"id":121,"title":"Automatic Behaviour Understanding in Medicine","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267155572_Automatic_Behaviour_Understanding_in_Medicine","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Now that Affective Computing and Social Signal Process-ing methods are becoming increasingly robust and accu-rate, novel areas of applications with significant societal im-pact are opening up for exploration. Perhaps one of the most promising areas is the application of automatic expres-sive behaviour understanding to help diagnose, monitor, and treat medical conditions that themselves alter a person's so-cial and affective signals. This work argues that this is now essentially a new area of research, called behaviomedics. It gives a definition of the area, discusses the most important groups of medical conditions that could benefit from this, and makes suggestions for future directions.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
