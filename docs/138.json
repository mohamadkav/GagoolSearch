For that, we adapt recently developed globalized variants of the projected gradient method to a convex constrained\n <br> least-squares approach for solving GSE. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two different applications. First,\n <br> we apply it to solve the GSE that appears after applying left and right preconditioning schemes to the linear problems associated\n <br> with the discretization of some partial differential equations. Second, we apply the new approach, combined with a Tikhonov\n <br> regularization term, to restore some blurred and highly noisy images.\n <br> \n <br> KeywordsConvex optimization–Spectral projected gradient method–Generalized Sylvester equation–Image restoration\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
