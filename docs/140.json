{"id":140,"title":"Partial Spectral Projected Gradient Method with Active-Set Strategy for Linearly Constrained Optimization","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225778113_Partial_Spectral_Projected_Gradient_Method_with_Active-Set_Strategy_for_Linearly_Constrained_Optimization","abstraction":"A method for linearly constrained optimization which modifies and generalizes recent box-constraint optimization algorithms is introduced. The new algorithm is based on a relaxed form of Spectral Projected Gradient iterations. Intercalated with these projected steps, internal iterations restricted to faces of the polytope are performed, which enhance the efficiency of the algorithm. Convergence proofs are given and numerical experiments are included and commented.
