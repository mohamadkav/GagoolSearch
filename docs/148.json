In this contribution we discuss two different strategies\n <br> for robust discrimination of such events: dynamic modelling by a broad selection of diverse acoustic Low-Level-Descriptors\n <br> vs. static modelling by projection of these via statistical functionals onto a 0.6k feature space with subsequent de-correlation.\n <br> As classifiers we employ Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, and Support Vector Machines, respectively. For discussion\n <br> of extensive parameter optimisation test-runs with respect to features and model topology, 2.9k non-verbals are extracted\n <br> from the spontaneous Audio-Visual Interest Corpus. 80.7% accuracy can be reported with, and 92.6% without a garbage model\n <br> for the discrimination of the named classes.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
