Our paper introduces a new inference algorithm for the innite Hidden Markov model called beam sam- pling. Beam sampling combines slice sam- pling, which limits the number of states con- sidered at each time step to a nite number, with dynamic programming, which samples whole state trajectories eciently. Our algo- rithm typically outperforms the Gibbs sam- pler and is more robust. We present appli- cations of iHMM inference using the beam sampler on changepoint detection and text prediction problems.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
