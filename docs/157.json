{"id":157,"title":"A two-layer model for music pleasure regression","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261235391_A_two-layer_model_for_music_pleasure_regression","abstraction":"We adopt a two-layer regression model for music pleasure regression. Pleasure orientation of a song is estimated first, and then different regressors are used to predict degree of pleasure according to the estimated orientation. By using corresponding regressors for each instance, there is a big improvement when we assume the first layer is perfect in comparison with one-layer model. By tuning the confidence threshold of the orientation classifier of the two-layer model, we get improvement over one-layer model."}
