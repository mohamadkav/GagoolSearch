{"id":16,"title":"Nonparametric Bayesian Image Segmentation","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225797350_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Image_Segmentation","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Image segmentation algorithms partition the set of pixels of an image into a specific number of different, spatially homogeneous\n <br> groups. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian model for histogram clustering which automatically determines the number of segments\n <br> when spatial smoothness constraints on the class assignments are enforced by a Markov Random Field. A Dirichlet process prior\n <br> controls the level of resolution which corresponds to the number of clusters in data with a unique cluster structure. The resulting posterior is efficiently\n <br> sampled by a variant of a conjugate-case sampling algorithm for Dirichlet process mixture models. Experimental results are\n <br> provided for real-world gray value images, synthetic aperture radar images and magnetic resonance imaging data.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
