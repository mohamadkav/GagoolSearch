In particular, employing a classical audio processing strategy, which has been proved quite successful in various audio recognition applications, we evaluate the appropriateness of six classifiers on the bird species recognition task. In the experimental evaluation of the acoustic bird recognizer, we made use of real-field audio recordings of two bird species, which are known to be present at the Hymettus Mountain. Encouraging recognition accuracy was obtained on the real-field data, and further experiments with additive noise demonstrated significant noise robustness in low SNR conditions.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
