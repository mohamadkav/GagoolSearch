One new approach is to make Metropolis-Hastings\n <br> updates of the indicators specifying which mixture component is associated\n <br> with each observation, perhaps supplemented with a partial form of\n <br> Gibbs sampling. The other new approach extends Gibbs sampling for\n <br> these indicators by using a set of auxiliary parameters. These methods\n <br> are simple to implement and are more efficient than previous ways\n <br> of handling general Dirichlet process mixture models with non-conjugate\n <br> priors.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
