{"id":163,"title":"Bayesian Agglomerative Clustering with Coalescents","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45860527_Bayesian_Agglomerative_Clustering_with_Coalescents","abstraction":"We introduce a new Bayesian model for hierarchical clustering based on a prior over trees called Kingman's coalescent. We develop novel greedy and sequential Monte Carlo inferences which operate in a bottom-up agglomerative fashion. We show experimentally the superiority of our algorithms over others, and demonstrate our approach in document clustering and phylolinguistics. Comment: NIPS 2008"}
