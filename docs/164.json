The two types of Gibbs samplers are quite different in nature. The é rst method is applicable when the prior can be characterized by a generalized Pólya urn mechanism and it involves drawing samples from the poste- rior of a hierarchical model formed by marginalizing over the prior. Our Pólya urn Gibbs sampler is a direct extension of the widely used Pólya urn sampler developed by Escobar (1988, 1994), MacEachern (1994), and Escobar and West (1995) for"}
