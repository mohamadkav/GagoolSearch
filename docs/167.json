We\n <br> focus on variants of Bayesian nonparametric hidden Markov models that enhance a\n <br> posteriori state-persistence in particular. This paper also introduces a new\n <br> Bayesian nonparametric framework for generating left-to-right and other\n <br> structured, explicit-duration infinite hidden Markov models that we call the\n <br> infinite structured hidden semi-Markov model.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
