We believe the relationship between\n <br> these two classes of events---something not previously studied\n <br> quantitatively---could yield important insights into the nature and intrinsic\n <br> dynamics of seizures. A goal of our work is to parse these complex epileptic\n <br> events into distinct dynamic regimes. A challenge posed by the intracranial EEG\n <br> (iEEG) data we study is the fact that the number and placement of electrodes\n <br> can vary between patients. We develop a Bayesian nonparametric Markov switching\n <br> process that allows for (i) shared dynamic regimes between a variable numbers\n <br> of channels, (ii) asynchronous regime-switching, and (iii) an unknown\n <br> dictionary of dynamic regimes. We encode a sparse and changing set of\n <br> dependencies between the channels using a Markov-switching Gaussian graphical\n <br> model for the innovations process driving the channel dynamics and demonstrate\n <br> the importance of this model in parsing and out-of-sample predictions of iEEG\n <br> data. We show that our model produces intuitive state assignments that can help\n <br> automate clinical analysis of seizures and enable the comparison of\n <br> sub-clinical bursts and full clinical seizures.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
