Appropriate discriminative and aggregative features are derived from beamformed and normalized matched-filtered data as recorded from a linear array towed behind an AUV. A clustering algorithm based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes is proposed for unsupervised classification of tracks. Overall improvement of target tracking is demonstrated via the Optimal Subpattern Assignment metric.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
