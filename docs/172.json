{"id":172,"title":"Inference in Hidden Markov Models with Explicit State Duration Distributions","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221667869_Inference_in_Hidden_Markov_Models_with_Explicit_State_DurationDistributions","abstraction":"In this letter we borrow from the inference techniques developed for unbounded state-cardinality (nonparametric) variants of the HMM and use them to develop a tuning-parameter free, black-box inference procedure for Explicit-state-duration hidden Markov models (EDHMM). EDHMMs are HMMs that have latent states consisting of both discrete state-indicator and discrete state-duration random variables. In contrast to the implicit geometric state duration distribution possessed by the standard HMM, EDHMMs allow the direct parameterisation and estimation of per-state duration distributions. As most duration distributions are defined over the positive integers, truncation or other approximations are usually required to perform EDHMM inference."}
