{"id":181,"title":"Histogram clustering for unsupervised segmentation and image retrieval","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222469073_Histogram_clustering_for_unsupervised_segmentation_and_image_retrieval","abstraction":"This paper introduces a novel statistical latent class model for probabilistic grouping of distributional and histogram data. Adopting the Bayesian framework, we propose to perform annealed maximum a posteriori estimation to compute optimal clustering solutions. In order to accelerate the optimization process, an efficient multiscale formulation is developed. We present a prototypical application of this method for unsupervised segmentation of textured images based on local distributions of Gabor coefficients. Benchmark results indicate superior performance compared to K-means clustering and proximity-based algorithms. In a second application the histogram clustering method is utilized to structure image databases for improved image retrieval."}
