The nonparametric model could replace the entire probability model, or some level of a hierarchical model. Specically, we dene nonparametric extensions of a parametric probability model using Dirichlet process (DP) priors. Similar approaches have been used in the literature to implement formal model t diagnostics (Carota, Parmigiani and Polson, 1996). In this paper we discuss at an operational level how such extensions can be implemented. Assuming that inference in the original parametric model is implemented by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, we show how minimal additional code can turn the same program into an implementation of MCMC in the larger encompassing model, allowing formal sensitivity analysis with respect to prior and likelihood assumptions.
