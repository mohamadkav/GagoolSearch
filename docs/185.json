We consider a class of prior distributions indexed by a hyperparameter that quantifies regularity. We prove that both methods we consider succeed in automatically selecting this parameter optimally, resulting in optimal convergence rates for truths with Sobolev or analytic \"smoothness\", without using knowledge about this regularity. Both methods are illustrated by simulation examples."}
