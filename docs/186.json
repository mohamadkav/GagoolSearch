The systems developed till now worldwide in this area are under\n <br> scanner for standardization. But, the situation of automatic gesture recognition\n <br> of Indian Sign Language is in its early stage. So, the focus of this research is to\n <br> develop an automatic gesture recognition system for Indian Sign Language. In\n <br> this paper, the focus is on the dataset development, application of various\n <br> feature extraction methods in combination with skin colour detection and\n <br> analysis of results of k-Nearest Neighbor and Neural Network classifiers in\n <br> specific words belongs to computer terminologies of Indian Sign Language.\n <br> The skin colour detection method helps us to extract hand and face portions of\n <br> images from input video frames. This ignores other components available in\n <br> image frames, like body parts and image background, which are not desired\n <br> features for the classification. The best results obtained from k-Nearest\n <br> Neighbor classifier is 97.04% with image pixel feature extraction method. An\n <br> accuracy rate of 97.00% obtained in combination of image pixel feature\n <br> extraction method and Neural Network classifier.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
