The model structure allows the automatic determination of the number of segments while ensuring spatial smoothness of the final output. This is achieved by defining two separate mixture weight sets: the first set of weights is spatially variant and incorporates an MRF edge-preserving smoothing prior; the second set of weights is governed by a Dirichlet prior in order to prune unnecessary mixture components. The model is trained using variational inference and the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm, resulting in closed-form parameter updates. The algorithm was successfully evaluated in terms of various segmentation indices using the Berkeley image data base.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
