{"id":189,"title":"Nonparametric Bayesian models through probit stick-breaking processes","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228562511_Nonparametric_Bayesian_models_through_probit_stick-breaking_processes","abstraction":"We describe a novel class of Bayesian nonparametric priors based on stick-breaking constructions where the weights of the process are constructed as probit transformations of normal random variables. We show that these priors are extremely flexible, allowing us to generate a great variety of models while preserv-ing computational simplicity. Particular emphasis is placed on the construction of rich temporal and spatial processes, which are applied to two problems in finance and ecology."}
