{"id":19,"title":"Bayesian Cluster Analysis","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31002185_Bayesian_Cluster_Analysis","abstraction":"SUMMARY A parametric model for partitioning individuals into mutually exclusive groups is given. A Bayesian analysis is applied and a loss structure imposed. A model-dependent definition of a similarity matrix is proposed and estimates based on this matrix are justified in a decision-theoretic framework. Some existing cluster analysis techniques are derived as special limiting cases. The results of the procedure applied to two data sets are compared with other analyses."}
