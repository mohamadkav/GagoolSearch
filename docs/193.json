This system was used in the 2007 National Institute of Standards\n <br> and Technology (NIST) Rich Transcription evaluation. The ICSI system automatically performs both speaker segmentation and\n <br> clustering without any prior knowledge of the identities or the number of speakers. Our system uses “standard” speech processing \n <br> components and techniques such as HMMs, agglomerative clustering, and the Bayesian Information Criterion. However, we have\n <br> developed the system with an eye towards robustness and ease of portability. Thus we have avoided the use of any sort of model\n <br> that requires training on “outside” data and we have attempted to develop algorithms that require as little tuning as possible.\n <br> \n <br> The system is simular to last year’s system [1] except for three aspects. We used the most recent available version of the\n <br> beam-forming toolkit, we implemented a new speech/non-speech detector that does not require models trained on meeting data\n <br> and we performed our development on a much larger set of recordings.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
