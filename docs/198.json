Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and\n <br> gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along\n <br> with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct\n <br> problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original\n <br> sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the\n <br> background required to pursue further this area of research. The author\n <br> first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the\n <br> concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic\n <br> function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is\n <br> illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the\n <br> classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are\n <br> noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are\n <br> given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including\n <br> ergodic as well as left-right models, are described\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
