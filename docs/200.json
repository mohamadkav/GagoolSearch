With the advent of\n <br> smartphones equipped with acceloremeter, gyroscope and camera; it is now\n <br> possible to develop activity classification platforms everyone can use\n <br> conveniently. In this paper, we propose a fast inference method for an\n <br> unsupervised non-parametric time series model namely variational inference for\n <br> sticky HDP-SLDS(Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Switching Linear Dynamical\n <br> System). We show that the proposed algorithm can differentiate various indoor\n <br> activities such as sitting, walking, turning, going up/down the stairs and\n <br> taking the elevator using only the acceloremeter of an Android smartphone\n <br> Samsung Galaxy S4. We used the front camera of the smartphone to annotate\n <br> activity types precisely. We compared the proposed method with Hidden Markov\n <br> Models with Gaussian emission probabilities on a dataset of 10 subjects. We\n <br> showed that the efficacy of the stickiness property. We further compared the\n <br> variational inference to the Gibbs sampler on the same model and show that\n <br> variational inference is faster in one order of magnitude.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
