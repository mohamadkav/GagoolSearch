In this paper, we introduce a novel spectral\n <br> algorithm to perform inference in HSMMs. Unlike expectation maximization (EM),\n <br> our approach correctly estimates the probability of given observation sequence\n <br> based on a set of training sequences. Our approach is based on estimating\n <br> certain sample moments, whose order depends only logarithmically on the maximum\n <br> length of the hidden state persistence. Moreover, the algorithm requires only a\n <br> few spectral decompositions and is therefore computationally efficient.\n <br> Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real data demonstrate the promise of the\n <br> algorithm.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
