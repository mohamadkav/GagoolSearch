{"id":210,"title":"Canal9: A database of political debates for analysis of social interactions","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224088111_Canal9_A_database_of_political_debates_for_analysis_of_social_interactions","abstraction":"Automatic analysis of social interactions attracts major attention in the computing community, but relatively few benchmarks are available to researchers active in the domain. This paper presents a new, publicly available, corpus of political debates including not only raw data, but a rich set of socially relevant annotations such as turn-taking (who speaks when and how much), agreement and disagreement between participants, and role played by people involved in each debate. The collection includes 70 debates for a total of 43 hours and 10 minutes of material."}
