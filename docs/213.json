{"id":213,"title":"Pulse spectral analysis from intensive care unit patients","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260732752_Pulse_spectral_analysis_from_intensive_care_unit_patients","abstraction":"The study analyzed the blood pressures in frequency domain from a group of ICU patients with kidney disease and compared the results with healthy control without kidney disease. Results showed 2nd harmonics had significantly larger energy distribution for patients with kidney disorder while the 4th to 6th harmonics had significantly smaller energy distribution when compared to the control group. The study provided evidence that pulse pressure harmonics are associated with individual vascular beds, such as the kidney vascular bed and indirectly support the resonance theory. The evidence will encourage more research to be done in order to generate substantial implications of pulse spectral analysis in clinical settings."}
