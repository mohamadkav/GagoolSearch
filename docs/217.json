The discriminative random fields improved the Hidden Conditional Random Fields' performance, this model got the behavior's internal dynamic characteristics and the external dynamic contacts. On the public human behavior database, by comparing the experimental results, it demonstrated that this method had better recognition results than the previous methods."}
