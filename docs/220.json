{"id":220,"title":"On Some Invariant Criteria for Grouping Data","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243620125_On_Some_Invariant_Criteria_for_Grouping_Data","abstraction":"This paper deals with methods of “cluster analysis”. In particular we attack the problem of exploring the structure of multivariate data in search of “clusters”.The approach taken is to use a computer procedure to obtain the “best” partition of n objects into g groups. A number of mathematical criteria for “best” are discussed and related to statistical theory. A procedure for optimizing the criteria is outlined. Some of the criteria are compared with respect to their behavior on actual data. Results of data analysis are presented and discussed."}
