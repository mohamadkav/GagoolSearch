{"id":221,"title":"Multivariate Clustering Procedures with Variable Metrics","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265372318_Multivariate_Clustering_Procedures_with_Variable_Metrics","abstraction":"Several multivariate clustering methods are analyzed in which each cluster may have a different metric depending on its covariance matrix. Numerical experiments show that the only reliable method among these is one using a metric suggested by Rohlf [1970] based on the within cluster covariance matrix normalized for unit determinant.
