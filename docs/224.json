The maximum-likelihood theory and numerical solution techniques are developed for a fairly general class of distributions. The theory is applied to mixtures of multivariate nor- mals (NORMIX) and mixtures of multivariate Bernoulli distributions (Latent Classes). The feasibility of the procedures is demonstrated by two examples of computer solutions for normal mixture models of the Fisher Iris data and of artifjcially generated clusters with unequal covariance matrices.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
