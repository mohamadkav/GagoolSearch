This method is equivariant with respect to relabeling units; unsampled units do not interfere with sampled data; and missing data do not hinder infer-ence. Cluster inference using the posterior mode performs well on simulated and real data sets, 10 and the posterior predictive distribution enables supervised learning based on a partial clustering of the sample.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
