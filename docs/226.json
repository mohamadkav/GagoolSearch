Given its significance, there has been a large body\n <br> of literature among which many are not statistically based. In this paper, we\n <br> propose a novel stochastic blockmodel based on a logistic regression setup with\n <br> node correction terms to better address this problem. We follow a Bayesian\n <br> approach that explicitly captures the community behavior via prior\n <br> specification. We then adopt a data augmentation strategy with latent\n <br> Polya-Gamma variables to obtain posterior samples. We conduct inference based\n <br> on a canonically mapped centroid estimator that formally addresses label\n <br> non-identifiability. We demonstrate the novel proposed model and estimation on\n <br> real-world as well as simulated benchmark networks and show that the proposed\n <br> model and estimator are more flexible, representative, and yield smaller error\n <br> rates when compared to the MAP estimator from classical degree-corrected\n <br> stochastic blockmodels.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
