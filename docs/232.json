{"id":232,"title":"Clustering Based on a Multilayer Mixture Model","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238879801_Clustering_Based_on_a_Multilayer_Mixture_Model","abstraction":"In model-based clustering, the density of each cluster is usually assumed to be a certain basic parametric distribution, for example, the normal distribution. In practice, it is often difficult to decide which parametric distribution is suitable to characterize a cluster, especially for multivariate data. Moreover, the densities of individual clusters may be multimodal themselves, and therefore cannot be accurately modeled by basic parametric distributions. This article explores a clustering approach that models each cluster by a mixture of normals. The resulting overall model is a multilayer mixture of normals. Algorithms to estimate the model and perform clustering are developed based on the classification maximum likelihood (CML) and mixture maximum likelihood (MML) criteria. BIC and ICL-BIC are examined for choosing the number of normal components per cluster. Experiments on both simulated and real data are presented."}
