These Bayesian nonparametric models are usually fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or sequential importance sampling (SIS). The latest generation of Gibbs and Gibbs-like samplers for both conjugate and nonconjugate DPM models effectively update the model parameters, but can have difficulty in updating the clustering of the data. To overcome this deficiency, merge-split samplers have been developed, but until now these have been limited to conjugate or conditionally-conjugate DPM models. This paper proposes a new MCMC sampler, called the sequentially-allocated merge-split (SAMS) sampler. The sam-pler borrows ideas from sequential importance sampling. Splits are proposed by sequentially allocating observations to one of two split components using allocation probabilities that condi-tion on previously allocated data. The SAMS sampler is applicable to general nonconjugate DPM models as well as conjugate models. Further, the proposed sampler is substantially more efficient than existing conjugate and nonconjugate samplers."}
