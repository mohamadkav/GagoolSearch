Commonly referred to as phenotype identification, solutions to this task often involve the application of unsupervised clustering techniques. In this paper, we investigate the application of a Dirichlet process mixture model for this task. This model is defined by the placement of the Dirichlet process on the unknown components of a mixture model, allowing for the expression of uncertainty about the partitioning of observed data into homogeneous subgroups. To exemplify this approach, an application to phenotype identification in Parkinson's disease is considered, with symptom profiles collected using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale."}
