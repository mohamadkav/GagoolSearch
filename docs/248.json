This paper introduces a Gibbs sampling algorithm that combines the slice\n <br> sampling approach of Walker (2007) and the retrospective sampling approach of\n <br> Papaspiliopoulos and Roberts (2008). Our general algorithm is implemented as\n <br> efficient open source C++ software, available as an R package, and is based on\n <br> a blocking strategy similar to that suggested by Papaspiliopoulos (2008) and\n <br> implemented by Yau et al (2011).\n <br> We discuss the difficulties of achieving good mixing in MCMC samplers of this\n <br> nature and investigate sensitivity to initialisation. We additionally consider\n <br> the challenges when an additional layer of hierarchy is added such that joint\n <br> inference is to be made on alpha. We introduce a new label switching move and\n <br> compute the marginal model posterior to help to surmount these difficulties.\n <br> Our work is illustrated using a profile regression (Molitor et al, 2010)\n <br> application, where we demonstrate good mixing behaviour for both synthetic and\n <br> real examples.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
