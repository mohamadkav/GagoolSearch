{"id":25,"title":"Concentration inequalities for sampling without replacement","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256606492_Concentration_inequalities_for_sampling_without_replacement","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Concentration inequalities quantify the deviation of a random variable from a\n <br> fixed value. In spite of numerous applications, such as opinion surveys or\n <br> ecological counting procedures, few concentration results are known for the\n <br> setting of sampling without replacement from a finite population. Until now,\n <br> the best general concentration inequality has been a Hoeffding inequality due\n <br> to Serfling (1974). In this paper, we first improve on the fundamental result\n <br> of Serfling (1974), and further extend it to obtain a Bernstein concentration\n <br> bound for sampling without replacement. We then derive an empirical version of\n <br> our bound that does not require the variance to be known to the user.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
