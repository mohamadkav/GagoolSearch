{"id":254,"title":"The infinite HMM for unsupervised PoS tagging","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012999_The_infinite_HMM_for_unsupervised_PoS_tagging","abstraction":"We extend previous work on fully unsu- pervised part-of-speech tagging. Using a non-parametric version of the HMM, called the infinite HMM (iHMM), we ad- dress the problem of choosing the number of hidden states in unsupervised Markov models for PoS tagging. We experi- ment with two non-parametric priors, the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes, on the Wall Street Journal dataset using a paral- lelized implementation of an iHMM in- ference algorithm. We evaluate the re- sults with a variety of clustering evalua- tion metrics and achieve equivalent or bet- ter performances than previously reported. Building on this promising result we eval- uate the output of the unsupervised PoS tagger as a direct replacement for the out- put of a fully supervised PoS tagger for the task of shallow parsing and compare the two evaluations."}
