{"id":265,"title":"A Stochastic Approximation Method","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236736791_A_Stochastic_Approximation_Method","abstraction":"Let $M(x)$ denote the expected value at level $x$ of the response to a certain experiment. $M(x)$ is assumed to be a monotone function of $x$ but is unknown to the experimenter, and it is desired to find the solution $x = \\theta$ of the equation $M(x) = \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is a given constant. We give a method for making successive experiments at levels $x_1,x_2,\\cdots$ in such a way that $x_n$ will tend to $\\theta$ in probability."}
