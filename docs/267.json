{"id":267,"title":"Sequential MCMC for Bayesian model selection","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3807947_Sequential_MCMC_for_Bayesian_model_selection","abstraction":"In this paper, we address the problem of sequential Bayesian model selection. This problem does not usually admit any closed-form analytical solution. We propose here an original sequential simulation-based method to solve the associated Bayesian computational problems. This method combines sequential importance sampling, a resampling procedure and reversible jump MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) moves. We describe a generic algorithm and then apply it to the problem of sequential Bayesian model order estimation of autoregressive (AR) time series observed in additive noise"}
