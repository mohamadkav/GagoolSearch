Historically, robust models were mostly developed on a\n <br> case-by-case basis; examples include robust linear regression, robust mixture\n <br> models, and bursty topic models. In this paper we develop a general approach to\n <br> robust Bayesian modeling. We show how to turn an existing Bayesian model into a\n <br> robust model, and then develop a generic strategy for computing with it. We use\n <br> our method to study robust variants of several models, including linear\n <br> regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and probabilistic topic\n <br> models. We discuss the connections between our methods and existing approaches,\n <br> especially empirical Bayes and James-Stein estimation.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
