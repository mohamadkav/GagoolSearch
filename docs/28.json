Comput. 36:45–54, 2007). This new sampler allows for the fitting of infinite mixture models with a wide-range of prior specifications. To illustrate\n <br> this flexibility we consider priors defined through infinite sequences of independent positive random variables. Two applications\n <br> are considered: density estimation using mixture models and hazard function estimation. In each case we show how the slice\n <br> efficient sampler can be applied to make inference in the models. In the mixture case, two submodels are studied in detail.\n <br> The first one assumes that the positive random variables are Gamma distributed and the second assumes that they are inverse-Gaussian\n <br> distributed. Both priors have two hyperparameters and we consider their effect on the prior distribution of the number of\n <br> occupied clusters in a sample. Extensive computational comparisons with alternative “conditional” simulation techniques for\n <br> mixture models using the standard Dirichlet process prior and our new priors are made. The properties of the new priors are\n <br> illustrated on a density estimation problem.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
