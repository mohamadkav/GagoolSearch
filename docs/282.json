They have therefore not\n <br> been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically\n <br> not fixed. This paper proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between\n <br> parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide\n <br> applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis\n <br> in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
