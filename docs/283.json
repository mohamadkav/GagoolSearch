One solution is a group sequential design dividing patient entry into a number of equal-sized\n <br> groups so that the decision to stop the trial or continue is based on repeated significance tests of the accumulated data\n <br> after each group is evaluated. Exact results are obtained for a trial with two treatments and a normal response with known\n <br> variance. The design problem of determining the required size and number of groups is also considered. Simulation shows that\n <br> these normal results may be adapted to other types of response data. An example shows that group sequential designs can sometimes\n <br> be statistically superior to standard sequential designs.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
