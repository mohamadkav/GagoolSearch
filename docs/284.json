(1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties\n <br> of assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices\n <br> and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
