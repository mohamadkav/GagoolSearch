Bayesian estimation in this setting remains challenging, with\n <br> a lack of computational methodology to fully exploit modern processing\n <br> capabilities. In this paper we introduce novel control variates for intractable\n <br> likelihoods that can reduce the Monte Carlo variance of Bayesian estimators, in\n <br> some cases dramatically. We prove that these control variates are well-defined,\n <br> provide a positive variance reduction and derive optimal tuning parameters that\n <br> are targeted at optimising this variance reduction. Moreover, the methodology\n <br> is highly parallelisable and offers a route to exploit multi-core processing\n <br> architectures for Bayesian computation. Results presented on the Ising model,\n <br> exponential random graphs and nonlinear stochastic differential equations\n <br> support our theoretical findings.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
