Inspired by Approximate Bayesian Computation, we\n <br> design a Markov chain whose transition makes use of an unknown but fixed,\n <br> fraction of the available data, where the random choice of sub-sample is guided\n <br> by the fidelity of this sub-sample to the observed data, as measured by summary\n <br> (or sufficient) statistics. LWA-MCMC is a generic and flexible approach, as\n <br> illustrated by the diverse set of examples which we explore. In each case\n <br> LWA-MCMC yields excellent performance and in some cases a dramatic improvement\n <br> compared to existing methodology.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
