We\n <br> offer in this paper a useful generalisation of the Delayed Acceptance approach,\n <br> devised to reduce the computational costs of such algorithms by a simple and\n <br> universal divide-and-conquer strategy. The idea behind the generic acceleration\n <br> is to divide the acceptance step into several parts, aiming at a major\n <br> reduction in computing time that out-ranks the corresponding reduction in\n <br> acceptance probability. Each of the components can be sequentially compared\n <br> with a uniform variate, the first rejection signalling that the proposed value\n <br> is considered no further. We develop moreover theoretical bounds for the\n <br> variance of associated estimators with respect to the variance of the standard\n <br> Metropolis-Hastings and detail some results on optimal scaling and general\n <br> optimisation of the procedure. We illustrate those accelerating features on a\n <br> series of examples\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
