The bounds lead us to consider sample variance penalization, a novel learning method which takes into account the empirical variance of the loss function. We give conditions under which sample variance penalization is effective. In particular, we present a bound on the excess risk incurred by the method. Using this, we argue that there are situations in which the excess risk of our method is of order 1/n, while the excess risk of empirical risk minimization is of order 1/sqrt/{n}. We show some experimental results, which confirm the theory. Finally, we discuss the potential application of our results to sample compression schemes. Comment: 10 pages, 1 figure, Proc.
