{"id":303,"title":"Exponential bounds for the hypergeometric distribution","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280589952_Exponential_bounds_for_the_hypergeometric_distribution","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n We establish exponential bounds for the hypergeometric distribution which\n <br> include a finite sampling correction factor, but are otherwise analogous to\n <br> bounds for the binomial distribution due to Le\\'on and Perron (2003) and\n <br> Talagrand (1994). We also establish a convex ordering for sampling without\n <br> replacement from populations of real numbers between zero and one: a population\n <br> of all zeros or ones (and hence yielding a hypergeometric distribution in the\n <br> upper bound) gives the extreme case.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
