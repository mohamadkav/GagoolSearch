{"id":304,"title":"Validation of Network Reconciliation","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267759898_Validation_of_Network_Reconciliation","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Network reconciliation is the problem of identifying nodes in separate\n <br> networks that represent the same entity, for example matching nodes across\n <br> social networks that correspond to the same user. We introduce a technique to\n <br> compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on precision and recall for\n <br> network reconciliation algorithms. The bounds require some verified matches,\n <br> but those matches may be used to develop the algorithms. The bounds do not\n <br> require knowledge of the network generation process, and they can supply\n <br> confidence levels for individual matches.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
