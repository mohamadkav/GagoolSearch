This article provides a survey of the recent\n <br> advances in Big learning with Bayesian methods, termed Big Bayesian Learning,\n <br> including nonparametric Bayesian methods for adaptively inferring model\n <br> complexity, regularized Bayesian inference for improving the flexibility via\n <br> posterior regularization, and scalable algorithms and systems based on\n <br> stochastic subsampling and distributed computing for dealing with large-scale\n <br> applications.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
