The use of\n <br> the scan statistics in such settings yields an hypotheses testing procedure,\n <br> where the null hypothesis corresponds to the absence of anomalous behavior. If\n <br> the null distribution is known, then calibration of a scan-based test is\n <br> relatively easy, as it can be done by Monte-Carlo simulation. When the null\n <br> distribution is unknown, it is not clear what the best way to proceed is. We\n <br> propose two procedures. One is a calibration by permutation and the other is a\n <br> rank-based scan test, which is distribution-free and less sensitive to\n <br> outliers. Furthermore, the rank-scan test requires only a one-time calibration\n <br> for a given data size making it computationally more appealing. In both cases,\n <br> we quantify the performance loss with respect to an oracle scan test that knows\n <br> the null distribution, and show one incurs only a very small loss in the\n <br> context of a natural exponential family. These results include the classical\n <br> normal location model, as well as Poisson model popular in syndromic\n <br> surveillance. We perform numerical experiments on simulated data further\n <br> supporting our theory, and also experiments with a real dataset from genomics.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
