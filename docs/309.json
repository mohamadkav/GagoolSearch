Such a factorization can be\n <br> visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this\n <br> tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the\n <br> sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a\n <br> single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm\n <br> computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions\n <br> derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed\n <br> in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital\n <br> communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product\n <br> algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi\n <br> algorithm, the iterative “turbo” decoding algorithm, Pearl's\n <br> (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman\n <br> filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
