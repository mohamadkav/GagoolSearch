{"id":310,"title":"Learning the structure of Markov logic networks","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345687_Learning_the_structure_of_Markov_logic_networks","abstraction":"Markov logic networks (MLNs) combine logic and probability by attaching weights to rst-order clauses, and viewing these as templates for features of Markov networks. In this paper we develop an algorithm for learning the structure of MLNs from relational databases, combining ideas from inductive logic pro- gramming (ILP) and feature induction in Markov net- works. The algorithm performs a beam or shortest- rst search of the space of clauses, guided by a weighted pseudo-likelihood measure. This requires computing the optimal weights for each candidate structure, but we show how this can be done ef- ciently. The algorithm can be used to learn an MLN from scratch, or to rene an existing knowledge base. We have applied it in two real-world domains, and found that it outperforms using off-the-shelf ILP sys- tems to learn the MLN structure, as well as pure ILP, purely probabilistic and purely knowledge-based ap- proaches."}
