{"id":328,"title":"A Few Notes on Statistical Learning Theory","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2852039_A_Few_Notes_on_Statistical_Learning_Theory","abstraction":"this article is on the theoretical side and not on the applicative one; hence, we shall not present examples which may be interesting from the practical point of view but have little theoretical significance. This survey is far from being complete and it focuses on problems the author finds interesting (an opinion which is not necessarily shared by the majority of the learning community). Relevant books which present a more evenly balanced approach are, for example [1, 4, 35, 36] The starting point of our discussion is the formulation of the learning problem. Consider a class G, consisting of real valued functions defined on a space #, and assume that each g G maps # into [0, 1]. Let T be an unknown function, T : # [0, 1] and set to be an unknown probability measure on #"}
