We first\n <br> introduce the canonical formulation of the large-scale optimization problem.\n <br> Next, we describe the general form of ADMM and then focus on several direct\n <br> extensions and sophisticated modifications of ADMM from $2$-block to $N$-block\n <br> settings to deal with the optimization problem. The iterative schemes and\n <br> convergence properties of each extension/modification are given, and the\n <br> implementation on large-scale computing facilities is also illustrated.\n <br> Finally, we numerate several applications in power system for distributed\n <br> robust state estimation, network energy management and security constrained\n <br> optimal power flow problem.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
