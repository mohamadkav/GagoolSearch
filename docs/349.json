{"id":349,"title":"Bayesian Nonparametric Crowdsourcing","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264085032_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Crowdsourcing","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Crowdsourcing has been proven to be an effective and efficient tool to\n <br> annotate large datasets. User annotations are often noisy, so methods to\n <br> combine the annotations to produce reliable estimates of the ground truth are\n <br> necessary. We claim that considering the existence of clusters of users in this\n <br> combination step can improve the performance. This is especially important in\n <br> early stages of crowdsourcing implementations, where the number of annotations\n <br> is low. At this stage there is not enough information to accurately estimate\n <br> the bias introduced by each annotator separately, so we have to resort to\n <br> models that consider the statistical links among them. In addition, finding\n <br> these clusters is interesting in itself as knowing the behavior of the pool of\n <br> annotators allows implementing efficient active learning strategies. Based on\n <br> this, we propose in this paper two new fully unsupervised models based on a\n <br> Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) prior and a hierarchical structure that allows\n <br> inferring these groups jointly with the ground truth and the properties of the\n <br> users. Efficient inference algorithms based on Gibbs sampling with auxiliary\n <br> variables are proposed. Finally, we perform experiments, both on synthetic and\n <br> real databases, to show the advantages of our models over state-of-the-art\n <br> algorithms.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
