The specific tasks studied are paddle juggling, ball-in-a-wedge juggling, five ball juggling, and devil sticking. All dynamic tasks introduced are solved by special purpose systems. The results of these investigations may provide insight into how open loop control can serve as a useful foundation for closed loop control and, particularly, what to focus on in learning control"}
