{"id":365,"title":"Sub-sampling: Real-time vision for micro air vehicles","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220143231_Sub-sampling_Real-time_vision_for_micro_air_vehicles","abstraction":"Small robotic systems such as Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) need to react quickly to their dynamic environments, while having only a limited amount of energy and processing onboard. In this article, sub-sampling of local image samples is investigated as a straightforward and broadly applicable approach to improve the computational efficiency of vision algorithms. In sub-sampling, only a small subset of the total number of samples is processed, leading to a significant reduction of the computational effort at the cost of a slightly lower accuracy. The possibility to change the number of extracted samples is of particular importance to autonomous robots, since it allows the designer to select not only the performance but also the execution frequency of the algorithm. The approach of sub-sampling is illustrated by introducing two novel, computationally efficient algorithms for two tasks relevant to MAVs: WiFi noise detection in camera images and onboard horizon detection for pitch and roll estimation. In the noise detection task, image lines and pixel pairs are sampled, while in the horizon detection task features from local image patches are sampled. For both tasks experiments are performed and the effects of sub-sampling are analyzed. It is demonstrated that even for small images of size 160×120 speed-ups of a factor 14 to 21 are reached, while retaining a sufficient performance for the tasks at hand."}
