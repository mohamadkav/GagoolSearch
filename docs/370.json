{"id":370,"title":"A Sequential Procedure for Selecting the Population with the Largest Mean from $k$ Normal Populations","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235709950_A_Sequential_Procedure_for_Selecting_the_Population_with_the_Largest_Mean_from_k_Normal_Populations","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n In this paper sequential procedures are given for selecting the normal population with the greatest mean when (a) the $k$ populations have a common known variance or (b) the $k$ populations have a common but unknown variance, so that in each case the probability of making the correct selection exceeds a specified value when the greatest mean exceeds all other means by at least a specified amount. The procedures in the present paper all have the property that inferior populations can be eliminated from further consideration as the experiment proceeds.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
