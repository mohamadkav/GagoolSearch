{"id":376,"title":"Near-Optimal Adaptive Compressed Sensing","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242014552_Near-Optimal_Adaptive_Compressed_Sensing","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n This paper proposes a simple adaptive sensing and group testing algorithm for\n <br> sparse signal recovery. The algorithm, termed Compressive Adaptive Sense and\n <br> Search (CASS), is shown to be near-optimal in that it succeeds at the lowest\n <br> possible signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) levels. Like traditional compressed\n <br> sensing based on random non-adaptive design matrices, the CASS algorithm\n <br> requires only k log n measurements to recover a k-sparse signal of dimension n.\n <br> However, CASS succeeds at SNR levels that are a factor log n less than required\n <br> by standard compressed sensing. From the point of view of constructing and\n <br> implementing the sensing operation as well as computing the reconstruction, the\n <br> proposed algorithm is substantially less computationally intensive than\n <br> standard compressed sensing. CASS is also demonstrated to perform considerably\n <br> better in practice through simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is\n <br> the first demonstration of an adaptive compressed sensing algorithm with\n <br> near-optimal theoretical guarantees and excellent practical performance. This\n <br> paper also shows that methods like compressed sensing, group testing, and\n <br> pooling have an advantage beyond simply reducing the number of measurements or\n <br> tests -- adaptive versions of such methods can also improve detection and\n <br> estimation performance when compared to non-adaptive direct (uncompressed)\n <br> sensing.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
