{"id":38,"title":"Infinite Latent Feature Models and the Indian Buffet Process","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270203_Infinite_Latent_Feature_Models_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","abstraction":"We define a probability distribution over equivalence classes of binary ma- trices with a finite number of rows and an unbounded number of columns. This distribution is suitable for use as a prior in probabilistic models that represent objects using a potentially infinite array of features. We derive the distribution by taking the limit of a distribution over N × K binary matrices as K ! 1, a strategy inspired by the derivation of the Chinese restaurant process (Aldous, 1985; Pitman, 2002) as the limit of a Dirichlet-multinomial model. This strategy preserves the exchangeability of the rows of matrices. We define several simple generative processes that result in the same distri- bution over equivalence classes of binary matrices, one of which we call the Indian buffet process. We illustrate the use of this distribution as a prior in an infinite latent feature model, deriving a Markov chain Monte Carlo algo- rithm for inference in this model and applying this algorithm to an artificial dataset."}
