{"id":397,"title":"The Population Posterior and Bayesian Inference on Streams","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280243202_The_Population_Posterior_and_Bayesian_Inference_on_Streams","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Many modern data analysis problems involve inferences from streaming data.\n <br> However, streaming data is not easily amenable to the standard probabilistic\n <br> modeling approaches, which assume that we condition on finite data. We develop\n <br> population variational Bayes, a new approach for using Bayesian modeling to\n <br> analyze streams of data. It approximates a new type of distribution, the\n <br> population posterior, which combines the notion of a population distribution of\n <br> the data with Bayesian inference in a probabilistic model. We study our method\n <br> with latent Dirichlet allocation and Dirichlet process mixtures on several\n <br> large-scale data sets.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
