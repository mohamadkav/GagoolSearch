We argue that through the use of high-level latent\n <br> random variables, our variational RNN (VRNN) is able to learn to model the kind\n <br> of variability observed in highly-structured sequential data (such as speech).\n <br> We empirically evaluate the proposed model against related sequential models on\n <br> five sequence datasets, four of speech and one of handwriting. Our results show\n <br> the importance of the role random variables can play in the RNN dynamic latent\n <br> state.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
