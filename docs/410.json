{"id":410,"title":"Nonparametric Bayesian sparse factor models with application to gene expression modeling","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47843669_Nonparametric_Bayesian_sparse_factor_models_with_application_to_geneexpression_modeling","abstraction":"A nonparametric Bayesian extension of Factor Analysis (FA) is proposed where observed data $\\mathbf{Y}$ is modeled as a linear superposition, $\\mathbf{G}$, of a potentially infinite number of hidden factors, $\\mathbf{X}$. The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) is used as a prior on $\\mathbf{G}$ to incorporate sparsity and to allow the number of latent features to be inferred. The model's utility for modeling gene expression data is investigated using randomly generated data sets based on a known sparse connectivity matrix for E. Coli, and on three biological data sets of increasing complexity."}
