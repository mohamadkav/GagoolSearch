{"id":415,"title":"Stochastic Variational Inference","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228092206_Stochastic_Variational_Inference","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n We develop stochastic variational inference, a scalable algorithm for\n <br> approximating posterior distributions. We develop this technique for a large\n <br> class of probabilistic models and we demonstrate it with two probabilistic\n <br> topic models, latent Dirichlet allocation and the hierarchical Dirichlet\n <br> process topic model. Using stochastic variational inference, we analyze several\n <br> large collections of documents: 300K articles from Nature, 1.8M articles from\n <br> The New York Times, and 3.8M articles from Wikipedia. Stochastic inference can\n <br> easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational\n <br> inference, which can only handle a smaller subset. (We also show that the\n <br> Bayesian nonparametric topic model outperforms its parametric counterpart.)\n <br> Stochastic variational inference lets us apply complex Bayesian models to\n <br> massive data sets.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
