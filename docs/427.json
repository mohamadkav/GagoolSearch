This enables us to explore a new synthesis of variational inference\n <br> and Monte Carlo methods where we incorporate one or more steps of MCMC into our\n <br> variational approximation. This note describes the theoretical foundations that\n <br> make this possible and shows some promising first results.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
