In\n <br> this note we offer details on how to efficiently implement this algorithm in\n <br> practice. We also suggest default choices for the form of the posterior\n <br> approximation, the number of iterations, the step size, and other user choices.\n <br> By using these defaults it becomes possible to construct good posterior\n <br> approximations for hierarchical models completely automatically.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
