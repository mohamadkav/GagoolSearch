We show that,\n <br> with a Gaussian mixture model, the approach is able to select an\n <br> “optimal” number of components in the model and so partition\n <br> data sets. The performance of the Bayesian method is compared to other\n <br> methods of optimal model selection and found to give good results. The\n <br> methods are tested on synthetic and real data sets\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
