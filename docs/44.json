{"id":44,"title":"Variational Inference for Gaussian Process Modulated Poisson Processes","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267759656_Variational_Inference_for_Gaussian_Process_Modulated_Poisson_Processes","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n We present the first fully variational Bayesian inference scheme for\n <br> continuous Gaussian-process-modulated Poisson processes. Such point processes\n <br> are used in a variety of domains, including neuroscience, geo-statistics and\n <br> astronomy, but their use is hindered by the computational cost of existing\n <br> inference schemes. Our scheme: requires no discretisation of the domain; scales\n <br> linearly in the number of observed events; and is many orders of magnitude\n <br> faster than previous sampling based approaches. The resulting algorithm is\n <br> shown to outperform standard methods on synthetic examples, coal mining\n <br> disaster data and in the prediction of Malaria incidences in Kenya.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
