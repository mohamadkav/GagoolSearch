To solve this semi-blind deconvolution\n <br> problem, prior distributions are specified for the PSF and the 3D image.\n <br> Joint image reconstruction and PSF estimation is then performed within a\n <br> Bayesian framework, using a variational algorithm to estimate the\n <br> posterior distribution. The image prior distribution imposes an explicit\n <br> atomic measure that corresponds to image sparsity. Importantly, the\n <br> proposed Bayesian deconvolution algorithm does not require hand tuning.\n <br> Simulation results clearly demonstrate that the semi-blind deconvolution\n <br> algorithm compares favorably with previous Markov chain Monte Carlo\n <br> (MCMC) version of myopic sparse reconstruction. It significantly\n <br> outperforms mismatched non-blind algorithms that rely on the assumption\n <br> of the perfect knowledge of the PSF. The algorithm is illustrated on\n <br> real data from magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM).\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
