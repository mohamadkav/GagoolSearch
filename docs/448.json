However,\n <br> existing approaches do not allow for the number of latent components (features)\n <br> to be automatically inferred from the data in an unsupervised manner. This is a\n <br> significant disadvantage of the state-of-the-art, as it results in considerable\n <br> burden imposed on researchers and practitioners, who must resort to tedious\n <br> cross-validation procedures to obtain the optimal number of latent features. To\n <br> resolve these issues, in this paper we introduce a convolutional nonparametric\n <br> Bayesian sparse ICA architecture for overcomplete feature learning from\n <br> high-dimensional data. Our method utilizes an Indian buffet process prior to\n <br> facilitate inference of the appropriate number of latent features under a\n <br> hybrid variational inference algorithm, scalable to massive datasets. As we\n <br> show, our model can be naturally used to obtain deep unsupervised hierarchical\n <br> feature extractors, by greedily stacking successive model layers, similar to\n <br> existing approaches. In addition, inference for this model is completely\n <br> heuristics-free; thus, it obviates the need of tedious parameter tuning, which\n <br> is a major challenge most deep learning approaches are faced with. We evaluate\n <br> our method on several action recognition benchmarks, and exhibit its advantages\n <br> over the state-of-the-art.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
