We show how to scale the model within a variational\n <br> inducing point framework, outperforming the state of the art on benchmark\n <br> datasets. Importantly, the variational formulation can be exploited to allow\n <br> classification in problems with millions of data points, as we demonstrate in\n <br> experiments.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
