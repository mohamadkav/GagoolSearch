Based on an equivalence between Indian buffet\n <br> and scale-invariant Poisson processes, we identify a random scaling variable\n <br> whose role is similar to that played in exchangeable partition models by the\n <br> total mass of a random measure. Analogous to the construction of exchangeable\n <br> partitions from normalized subordinators, random families of sets can be\n <br> constructed from randomly scaled subordinators. Coupling to a heavy-tailed\n <br> scaling variable induces a power law on the number of sets containing the first\n <br> $n$ elements. Several examples, with properties desirable in applications, are\n <br> derived explicitly. A relationship to exchangeable partitions is made precise\n <br> as a correspondence between scaled subordinators and Poisson-Kingman measures,\n <br> generalizing a result of Arratia, Barbour and Tavare on scale-invariant\n <br> processes.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
