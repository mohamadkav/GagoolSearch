As the marginal probability distribution of the BNBP that governs the\n <br> exchangeable random partitions of grouped data has not yet been developed,\n <br> current inference for the BNBP has to truncate the number of atoms of the beta\n <br> process. This paper introduces an exchangeable partition probability function\n <br> to explicitly describe how the BNBP clusters the data points of each group into\n <br> a random number of exchangeable partitions, which are shared across all the\n <br> groups. A fully collapsed Gibbs sampler is developed for the BNBP, leading to a\n <br> novel nonparametric Bayesian topic model that is distinct from existing ones,\n <br> with simple implementation, fast convergence, good mixing, and state-of-the-art\n <br> predictive performance.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
