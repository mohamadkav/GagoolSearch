{"id":468,"title":"Bayesian Nonparametric Dictionary Learning for Compressed Sensing MRI","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235438734_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Dictionary_Learning_for_Compressed_Sensing_MRI","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n We develop a Bayesian nonparametric model for reconstructing magnetic\n <br> resonance images (MRI) from highly undersampled k-space data. Our model uses\n <br> the beta process as a nonparametric prior for dictionary learning, in which an\n <br> image patch is a sparse combination of dictionary elements. The size of the\n <br> dictionary and the patch-specific sparsity pattern is inferred from the data,\n <br> in addition to all dictionary learning variables. Dictionary learning is\n <br> performed as part of the image reconstruction process, and so is tailored to\n <br> the MRI being considered. In addition, we investigate a total variation penalty\n <br> term in combination with the dictionary learning model. We derive a stochastic\n <br> optimization algorithm based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for\n <br> the Bayesian model, and use the alternating direction method of multipliers\n <br> (ADMM) for efficiently performing total variation minimization. We present\n <br> empirical results on several MRI, which show that the proposed regularization\n <br> framework can improve reconstruction accuracy over other methods.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
