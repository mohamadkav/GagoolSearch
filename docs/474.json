Section 2 provides a rather general theoretical setting and summarises key features of multivariate data models with hierarchical mixture priors. Section 3 discusses Markov chain simulation methods in these models, with special emphasis on models centred around traditional normal structures. Section 4 concerns an application in hierarchical regression, highlighting the use of mixture priors for robustness and sensitivity analysis, and Section 5 develops an application to multivariate density estimation. y\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
