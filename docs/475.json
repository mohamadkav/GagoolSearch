{"id":475,"title":"Parametric Mixture Models for Multi-Labeled Text.","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618091_Parametric_Mixture_Models_for_Multi-Labeled_Text","abstraction":"We propose probabilistic generative models, called parametric mix- ture models (PMMs), for multiclass, multi-labeled text categoriza- tion problem. Conventionally, the binary classication approach has been employed, in which whether or not text belongs to a cat- egory is judged by the binary classier for every category. In con- trast, our approach can simultaneously detect multiple categories of text using PMMs. We derive ecien t learning and prediction algo- rithms for PMMs. We also empirically show that our method could signican tly outperform the conventional binary methods when ap- plied to multi-labeled text categorization using real World Wide Web pages."}
