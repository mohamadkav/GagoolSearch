{"id":476,"title":"A semiparametric Bayesian model for randomised block designs","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243662369_A_semiparametric_Bayesian_model_for_randomised_block_designs","abstraction":"A model is proposed for a Bayesian semiparametric analysis of randomised block experiments. The model is a hierarchical model in which a Dirichlet process is inserted at the middle stage for the distribution of the block effects. This model allows an arbitrary distribution of block effects, and it results in effective estimates of treatment contrasts, block effects and the distribution of block effects. An effective computational strategy is presented for describing the posterior distribution."}
