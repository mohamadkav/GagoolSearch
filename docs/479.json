{"id":479,"title":"Bayesian Fuzzy Clustering","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282603739_Bayesian_Fuzzy_Clustering","abstraction":"We present a Bayesian probabilistic model and inference algorithm for fuzzy clustering that provides expanded capabilities over the traditional Fuzzy C-Means approach. Additionally, we extend the Bayesian Fuzzy Clustering model to handle a variable number of clusters and present a particle filter inference technique to estimate the model parameters including the number of clusters. We show results on synthetic and real data and compare with other approaches."}
