The appealing properties of such models are demonstrated theoretically as well as through data examples and simulations. In particular, the first, second and third-order properties are studied and utilized in the statistical analysis of clustered point patterns. Also empirical Bayesian inference for the underlying intensity surface is considered.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
