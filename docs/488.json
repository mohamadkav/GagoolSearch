{"id":488,"title":"Supervised Dimensionality Reduction via Distance Correlation Maximization","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289406962_Supervised_Dimensionality_Reduction_via_Distance_Correlation_Maximization","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n In our work, we propose a novel formulation for supervised dimensionality\n <br> reduction based on a nonlinear dependency criterion called Statistical Distance\n <br> Correlation, Szekely et. al. (2007). We propose an objective which is free of\n <br> distributional assumptions on regression variables and regression model\n <br> assumptions. Our proposed formulation is based on learning a low-dimensional\n <br> feature representation $\\mathbf{z}$, which maximizes the squared sum of\n <br> Distance Correlations between low dimensional features $\\mathbf{z}$ and\n <br> response $y$, and also between features $\\mathbf{z}$ and covariates\n <br> $\\mathbf{x}$. We propose a novel algorithm to optimize our proposed objective\n <br> using the Generalized Minimization Maximizaiton method of \\Parizi et. al.\n <br> (2015). We show superior empirical results on multiple datasets proving the\n <br> effectiveness of our proposed approach over several relevant state-of-the-art\n <br> supervised dimensionality reduction methods.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
