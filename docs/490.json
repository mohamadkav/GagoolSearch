{"id":490,"title":"Data-Dependent Path Normalization in Neural Networks","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284476101_Data-Dependent_Path_Normalization_in_Neural_Networks","abstraction":"We propose a unified framework for neural net normalization, regularization and optimization, which includes Path-SGD and Batch-Normalization and interpolates between them across two different dimensions. Through this framework we investigate issue of invariance of the optimization, data dependence and the connection with natural gradients."}
