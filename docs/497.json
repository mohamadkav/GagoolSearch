The Inverse\n <br> Ising problem specifically consists of searching for the maximal entropy\n <br> distribution reproducing frequencies and correlations of a binary data-set. In\n <br> order to solve this task, we propose an algorithm that takes advantage of the\n <br> provided by the data knowledge of the log-likelihood function around the\n <br> solution. We show that the present algorithm is faster than standard gradient\n <br> ascent methods. Moreover, by looking at the algorithm convergence as a\n <br> stochastic process, we properly define over-fitting and we show how the present\n <br> algorithm avoids it by construction.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
