{"id":499,"title":"Canonical row-column-exchangeable arrays","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23630041_Canonical_row-column-exchangeable_arrays","abstraction":"Consider a standard row-column-exchangeable array X = (Xij : i,j &gt;= 1), i.e., Xij = f(a, [xi]i, [eta]j, [lambda]ij) is a function of i.i.d. random variables. It is shown that there is a canonical version of X, X', such that X', and [alpha]', [xi]'1, [xi]'2,..., [eta]'1, [eta]'2,..., are conditionally independent given [intersection]n &gt;= 1 [sigma](X'ij : max(i,j) &gt;= n). This result is quite a bit simpler to prove than the analogous result for the original array X, which is due to Aldous."}
