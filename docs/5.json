Like other sampling algorithms, discrete\n <br> sampling also suffers from high computational burden in large-scale inference\n <br> problems. We study the problem of sampling a discrete random variable with a\n <br> high degree of dependency that is typical in large-scale Bayesian inference and\n <br> graphical models, and propose an efficient approximate solution with a\n <br> subsampling approach. We make a novel connection between the discrete sampling\n <br> and Multi-Armed Bandits problems with a finite reward population and provide\n <br> three algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Empirical evaluations show the\n <br> robustness and efficiency of the approximate algorithms in both synthetic and\n <br> real-world large-scale problems.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
