We show that under appropriate regularity conditions, the\n <br> mean-field value of the stochastic differential game with exponentiated\n <br> integral cost functional coincides with the value function described by a\n <br> Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with an additional quadratic term. We\n <br> provide an explicit solution of the mean-field best response when the\n <br> instantaneous cost functions are log-quadratic and the state dynamics are\n <br> affine in the control. An equivalent mean-field risk-neutral problem is\n <br> formulated and the corresponding mean-field equilibria are characterized in\n <br> terms of backward-forward macroscopic McKean-Vlasov equations,\n <br> Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations, and HJB equations. We provide numerical\n <br> examples on the mean field behavior to illustrate both linear and McKean-Vlasov\n <br> dynamics.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
