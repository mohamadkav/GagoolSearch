{"id":506,"title":"Record-dependent measures on the symmetric groups: Record-Dependent Measures","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221664737_Record-dependent_measures_on_the_symmetric_groups_Record-Dependent_Measures","abstraction":"Probability measure P_n on the symmetric group S_n is said to be record-dependent if P_n(s) depends only on the set of records of permutation s. A sequence P=(P_n) of consistent record-dependent measures determines a random order on the set of positive integers. In this paper we describe the extreme elements of the convex set of such P. This problem turns out to be related to the study of asymptotic behavior of permutation-valued growth processes, to random extensions of partial orders, and to the measures on the Young-Fibonacci lattice."}
