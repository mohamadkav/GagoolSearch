{"id":512,"title":"A Bayesian Analysis of Ordinal Data Using Mixtures","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2469179_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Ordinal_Data_Using_Mixtures","abstraction":"this paper, we discuss a Bayesian method for the analysis of ordinal data. It is assumed that the ordinal data arise from an underlying latent variable which is related to a set of covariates in a generalized linear model sense. The link function which associates the class probabilities to the set of covariates is estimated as a finite mixture of probit links, thereby introducing flexibility in the choice of the link function. The Bayesian model provides an easy-to-implement simulation environment and therefore avoids pitfalls of the expensive and numerically unstable maximum likelihood analysis. The class probabilities are estimated by considering the predictive distribution of a future observation given the set of covariates. Computations are performed using Gibbs sampling. The method is illustrated by using both simulated and real data sets."}
