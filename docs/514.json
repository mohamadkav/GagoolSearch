{"id":514,"title":"Nonparametric Bayesian Bioassay Including Ordered Polytomous Response","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31102905_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Bioassay_Including_Ordered_Polytomous_Response","abstraction":"Previous attempts at implementing fully Bayesian nonparametric bioassay have enjoyed limited success due to computational difficulties. We show here how this problem may be generally handled using a sampling based approach to develop desired marginal posterior distributions and their features. A useful extension is presented which treats the case of ordered polytomous response. Illustrative examples are provided."}
