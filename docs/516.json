It\n <br> shows, using the so called parameter separation parameterization, a simple\n <br> criterion under which the variational method works well. Based on this\n <br> framework, its provides a full variational solution for the Dirichlet process.\n <br> The numerical results show that the method is very computationally efficient\n <br> when compared to MCMC. Finally, we propose an empirical method to estimate the\n <br> truncation level for the truncated Dirichlet process.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
