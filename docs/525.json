{"id":525,"title":"Bayesian classification with Gaussian processes","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3192933_Bayesian_classification_with_Gaussian_processes","abstraction":"We consider the problem of assigning an input vector to one of m classes by predicting P(c|x) for c=1,...,m. For a two-class problem, the probability of class one given x is estimated by ?(y(x)), where ?(y)=1/(1+e\n<sup>-y</sup>). A Gaussian process prior is placed on y(x), and is combined with the training data to obtain predictions for new x points. We provide a Bayesian treatment, integrating over uncertainty in y and in the parameters that control the Gaussian process prior the necessary integration over y is carried out using Laplace's approximation. The method is generalized to multiclass problems (m&gt;2) using the softmax function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a number of datasets"}
