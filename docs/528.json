{"id":528,"title":"Gaussian Processes for Regression","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2320571_Gaussian_Processes_for_Regression","abstraction":"The Bayesian analysis of neural networks is difficult because a simple prior over weights implies a complex prior distribution over functions. In this paper we investigate the use of Gaussian process priors over functions, which permit the predictive Bayesian analysis for fixed values of hyperparameters to be carried out exactly using matrix operations. Two methods, using optimization and averaging (via Hybrid Monte Carlo) over hyperparameters have been tested on a number of challenging problems and have produced excellent results. 1 INTRODUCTION In the Bayesian approach to neural networks a prior distribution over the weights induces a prior distribution over functions. This prior is combined with a noise model, which specifies the probability of observing the targets t given function values y, to yield a posterior over functions which can then be used for predictions. For neural networks the prior over functions has a complex form which means that implementations must eithe..."}
