{"id":531,"title":"Structured neural network modelling of multi-valued functions for wind retrieval from scatterometer measurements","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222695635_Structured_neural_network_modelling_of_multi-valued_functions_for_wind_retrieval_from_scatterometer_measurements","abstraction":"A conventional neural network approach to regression problems approximates the conditional mean of the output vector. For mappings which are multi-valued this approach breaks down, since the average of two solutions is not necessarily a valid solution. In this article mixture density networks, a principled method for modelling conditional probability density functions, are applied to retrieving Cartesian wind vector components from satellite scatterometer data. A hybrid mixture density network is implemented to incorporate prior knowledge of the predominantly bimodal function branches. An advantage of a fully probabilistic model is that more sophisticated and principled methods can be used to resolve ambiguities."}
