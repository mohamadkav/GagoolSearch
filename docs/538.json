Compared to recently developed parametric\n <br> methods, the proposed frameworks feature accurate function approximation and\n <br> efficient on-line operations. Theoretically, we derive the mathematical\n <br> connection of KL control based on dynamic programming with earlier work in\n <br> control theory which relies on information theoretic dualities for case of\n <br> infinite time horizon problems. Algorithmically, we give analytical expressions\n <br> to optimal control policies in nonparametric forms, and propose on-line update\n <br> schemes with budgeted computational costs. Numerical results demonstrate the\n <br> effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed frameworks.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
