{"id":539,"title":"Indirect robot model learning for tracking control","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263593840_Indirect_robot_model_learning_for_tracking_control","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Learning task-space tracking control on redundant robot manipulators is an important but difficult problem. A main difficulty is the non-uniqueness of the solution: a task-space trajectory has multiple joint-space trajectories associated, therefore averaging over non-convex solution space needs to be done if treated as a regression problem. A second class of difficulties arise for those robots when the physical model is either too complex or even not available. In this situation machine learning methods may be a suitable alternative to classical approaches. We propose a learning framework for tracking control that is applicable for underactuated or non-rigid robots where an analytical physical model of the robot is unavailable. The proposed framework builds on the insight that tracking problems are well defined in the joint task- and joint-space coordinates and consequently predictions can be obtained via local optimization. Physical experiments show that state-of-the art accuracy can be achieved in both online and offline tracking control learning. Furthermore, we show that the presented method is capable of controlling underactuated robot architectures as well.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
