It is shown how the Girsanov theorem can be used for evaluating the likelihood ratios needed in importance sampling. It is also shown how the methodology can be applied to a class of models, where the driving noise process is lower in the dimensionality than the state and thus the laws of state and noise are not absolutely continuous. Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally Gaussian models and unknown static parameter models is also considered.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
