The current research works are primarily focused on static environments with earth fixed coordinate frames, having nonmoving maps. In this research work, we use micro electromechanical sensors based inertial sensors, band pass filtering, particle filtering, maps and map matching techniques for pedestrian localization with respect to on ground moving platforms such as train or bus. Since these platforms are moving, the maps of such platforms are moving maps with respect to earth centered, earth fixed coordinate frames. The techniques of this research work could further be extended and adapted to other moving platforms such as airplanes, boats and submarines.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
