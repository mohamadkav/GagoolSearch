In\n <br> this paper, we show how we can exploit arbitrarily accu- rate approximations to\n <br> a GMRF to speed up Krylov subspace sampling methods. We also show that these\n <br> methods can be used when computing the normalising constant of a large\n <br> multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is needed for both any\n <br> likelihood-based inference method. The method we derive is also applicable to\n <br> other structured Gaussian random vectors and, in particu- lar, we show that\n <br> when the precision matrix is a perturbation of a (block) circulant matrix, it\n <br> is still possible to derive O(n log n) sampling schemes.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
