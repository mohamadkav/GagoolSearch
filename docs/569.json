This paper proposes stochastic\n <br> gradient-based inference to draw samples from the posterior distribution over\n <br> covariance parameters with negligible bias and without the need to compute the\n <br> marginal likelihood. In Gaussian process regression, this has the enormous\n <br> advantage that stochastic gradients can be computed by solving linear systems\n <br> only. A novel unbiased linear systems solver based on parallelizable covariance\n <br> matrix-vector products is developed to accelerate the unbiased estimation of\n <br> gradients. The results demonstrate the possibility to enable scalable and exact\n <br> (in a Monte Carlo sense) quantification of uncertainty in Gaussian processes\n <br> without imposing any special structures on the covariance or reducing the\n <br> number of input vectors.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
