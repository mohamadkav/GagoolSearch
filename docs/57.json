{"id":57,"title":"Sequential Monte Carlo for rare event estimation","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226031060_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_for_rare_event_estimation","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n This paper discusses a novel strategy for simulating rare events and an associated Monte Carlo estimation of tail probabilities.\n <br> Our method uses a system of interacting particles and exploits a Feynman-Kac representation of that system to analyze their\n <br> fluctuations. Our precise analysis of the variance of a standard multilevel splitting algorithm reveals an opportunity for\n <br> improvement. This leads to a novel method that relies on adaptive levels and produces, in the limit of an idealized version\n <br> of the algorithm, estimates with optimal variance. The motivation for this theoretical work comes from problems occurring\n <br> in watermarking and fingerprinting of digital contents, which represents a new field of applications of rare event simulation\n <br> techniques. Some numerical results show performance close to the idealized version of our technique for these practical applications.\n <br> \n <br> KeywordsRare event–Sequential importance sampling–Feynman-Kac formula–Metropolis-Hastings–Fingerprinting–Watermarking\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
