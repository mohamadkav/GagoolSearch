We show how GPs can be vari- ationally\n <br> decomposed to depend on a set of globally relevant inducing variables which\n <br> factorize the model in the necessary manner to perform variational inference.\n <br> Our ap- proach is readily extended to models with non-Gaussian likelihoods and\n <br> latent variable models based around Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the\n <br> approach on a simple toy problem and two real world data sets.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
