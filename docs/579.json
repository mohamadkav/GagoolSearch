Such a method allows Gaussian\n <br> process classifiers to be trained on very large datasets that were out of the\n <br> reach of previous deployments of EP and has been shown to be competitive with\n <br> related techniques based on stochastic variational inference. Nevertheless, the\n <br> memory resources required scale linearly with the dataset size, unlike in\n <br> variational methods. This is a severe limitation when the number of instances\n <br> is very large. Here we show that this problem is avoided when stochastic EP is\n <br> used to train the model.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
