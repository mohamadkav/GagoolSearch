In the limit $n \\to \\infty$, it is well-known that, when the\n <br> variance of the proposal scales inversely proportional to the dimension $n$\n <br> whereas time is accelerated by the factor $n$, a diffusive limit is obtained\n <br> for each component of the Markov chain if this chain starts at equilibrium.\n <br> This paper extends this result when the initial distribution is not the target\n <br> probability measure. Remarking that the interaction between the components of\n <br> the chain due to the common acceptance/rejection of the proposed moves is of\n <br> mean-field type, we obtain a propagation of chaos result under the same scaling\n <br> as in the stationary case. This proves that, in terms of the dimension $n$, the\n <br> same scaling holds for the transient phase of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\n <br> as near stationarity. The diffusive and mean-field limit of each component is a\n <br> nonlinear diffusion process in the sense of McKean. This opens the route to new\n <br> investigations of the optimal choice for the variance of the proposal\n <br> distribution in order to accelerate convergence to equilibrium.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
