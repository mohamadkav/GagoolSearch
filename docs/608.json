{"id":608,"title":"Non?parametric Bayesian Estimation of a Spatial Poisson Intensity","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227686996_Non-parametric_Bayesian_Estimation_of_a_Spatial_Poisson_Intensity","abstraction":"A method introduced by Arjas &amp; Gasbarra (1994) and later modified by Arjas &amp; Heikkinen (1997) for the non-parametric Bayesian estimation of an intensity on the real line is generalized to cover spatial processes. The method is based on a model approximation where the approximating intensities have the structure of a piecewise constant function. Random step functions on the plane are generated using Voronoi tessellations of random point patterns. Smoothing between nearby intensity values is applied by means of a Markov random field prior in the spirit of Bayesian image analysis. The performance of the method is illustrated in examples with both real and simulated data."}
