{"id":615,"title":"The Intrinsic Random Functions and Their Applications","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230837892_The_Intrinsic_Random_Functions_and_Their_Applications","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n The intrinsic random functions (IRF) are a particular case of the Guelfand generalized processes with stationary increments. They constitute a much wider class than the stationary RF, and are used in practical applications for representing non-stationary phenomena. The most important topics considered are: existence of a generalized covariance (GC) for which statistical inference is possible from a unique realization; theory of the best linear intrinsic estimator (BLIE) used for contouring and estimating problems; the turning bands method for simulating IRF; and the models with polynomial GC, for which statistical inference may be performed by automatic procedures.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
