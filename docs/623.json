{"id":623,"title":"A J?function for Inhomogeneous Spatio?temporal Point Processes","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258849829_A_J-function_for_Inhomogeneous_Spatio-temporal_Point_Processes","abstraction":"We propose a new summary statistic for inhomogeneous intensity-reweighted moment stationary spatio-temporal point processes. The statistic is defined through the n-point correlation functions of the point process and it generalises the J-function when stationarity is assumed. We show that our statistic can be represented in terms of the generating functional and that it is related to the inhomogeneous K-function. We further discuss its explicit form under some specific model assumptions and derive a ratio-unbiased estimator. We finally illustrate the use of our statistic on simulated data."}
