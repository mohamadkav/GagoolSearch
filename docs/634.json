Our mixture-of-experts model is\n <br> conceptually simple and hierarchically recombines computations for an overall\n <br> approximation of a full Gaussian process. Closed-form and distributed\n <br> computations allow for efficient and massive parallelisation while keeping the\n <br> memory consumption small. Given sufficient computing resources, our model can\n <br> handle arbitrarily large data sets, without explicit sparse approximations. We\n <br> provide strong experimental evidence that our model can be applied to large\n <br> data sets of sizes far beyond millions. Hence, our model has the potential to\n <br> lay the foundation for general large-scale Gaussian process research.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
