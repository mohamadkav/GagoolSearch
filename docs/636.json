Here we\n <br> propose a novel method of extracting a low dimensional rep- resentation of\n <br> survival data by combining the popular Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model\n <br> (GPLVM) with a Weibull Proportional Hazards Model (WPHM). The model offers a\n <br> flexible non-linear probabilistic method of detecting and extracting any\n <br> intrinsic lower dimensional structure from high dimensional data. In addition\n <br> we can simultaneously combine information from multiple data sources. We\n <br> present results from several simulation studies that illustrate a reduction in\n <br> overfitting and an increase in predictive performance, as well as successful\n <br> detection of intrinsic dimensionality.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
