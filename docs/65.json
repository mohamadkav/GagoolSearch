{"id":65,"title":"Multiple co-clustering based on nonparametric mixture models with heterogeneous marginal distributions","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283117782_Multiple_co-clustering_based_on_nonparametric_mixture_models_with_heterogeneous_marginal_distributions","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n We propose a novel method for multiple clustering that assumes a\n <br> co-clustering structure (partitions in both rows and columns of the data\n <br> matrix) in each view. The new method is applicable to high-dimensional data. It\n <br> is based on a nonparametric Bayesian approach in which the number of views and\n <br> the number of feature-/subject clusters are inferred in a data-driven manner.\n <br> We simultaneously model different distribution families, such as Gaussian,\n <br> Poisson, and multinomial distributions in each cluster block. This makes our\n <br> method applicable to datasets consisting of both numerical and categorical\n <br> variables, which biomedical data typically do. Clustering solutions are based\n <br> on variational inference with mean field approximation. We apply the proposed\n <br> method to synthetic and real data, and show that our method outperforms other\n <br> multiple clustering methods both in recovering true cluster structures and in\n <br> computation time. Finally, we apply our method to a depression dataset with no\n <br> true cluster structure available, from which useful inferences are drawn about\n <br> possible clustering structures of the data.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
