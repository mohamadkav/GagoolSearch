{"id":651,"title":"Mind the Nuisance: Gaussian Process Classification using Privileged Noise","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263582568_Mind_the_Nuisance_Gaussian_Process_Classification_using_Privileged_Noise","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n The learning with privileged information setting has recently attracted a lot\n <br> of attention within the machine learning community, as it allows the\n <br> integration of additional knowledge into the training process of a classifier,\n <br> even when this comes in the form of a data modality that is not available at\n <br> test time. Here, we show that privileged information can naturally be treated\n <br> as noise in the latent function of a Gaussian Process classifier (GPC). That\n <br> is, in contrast to the standard GPC setting, the latent function is not just a\n <br> nuisance but a feature: it becomes a natural measure of confidence about the\n <br> training data by modulating the slope of the GPC sigmoid likelihood function.\n <br> Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed GPC method\n <br> using privileged noise, called GPC+, improves over a standard GPC without\n <br> privileged knowledge, and also over the current state-of-the-art SVM-based\n <br> method, SVM+. Moreover, we show that advanced neural networks and deep learning\n <br> methods can be compressed as privileged information.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
