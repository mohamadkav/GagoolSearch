{"id":655,"title":"Population Monte Carlo","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2836794_Population_Monte_Carlo","abstraction":"This paper shows that importance sampling can be iterated to produce more accurate approximations to iid sampling from a target distribution, than sequential sampling from an MCMC algorithm. We first illustrate the adaptability of the joint scheme on a toy mixture example. As a more realistic example, we then reanalyse the ion channel model of Hodgson (1999), using an importance sampling scheme based on a hidden Markov representation. The degeneracy phenomenon that usually occurs in particle systems is studied on both examples"}
