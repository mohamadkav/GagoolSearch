Even for tables of moderate size, these sets of models may be very large. The choice of suitable prior distributions for model parameters is also discussed in detail, and two examples are presented. For the first example, a three-way table, the model probabilities calculated using our reversible jump approach are compared with model probabilities calculated exactly or by using an alternative approximation. The second example is a six-way contingency table for which exact methods are infeasible, because of the large number of possible models. We identify the most probable hierarchical, graphical and decomposable models, and compare the results with alternatives approaches.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
