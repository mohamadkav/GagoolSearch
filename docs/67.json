One\n <br> vital factor that impacts clustering performance is how to learn or design the\n <br> data representation (or features). Fortunately, recent advances in deep\n <br> learning can learn unsupervised features effectively, and have yielded state of\n <br> the art performance in many classification problems, such as character\n <br> recognition, object recognition and document categorization. However, little\n <br> attention has been paid to the potential of deep learning for unsupervised\n <br> clustering problems. In this paper, we propose a deep belief network with\n <br> nonparametric clustering. As an unsupervised method, our model first leverages\n <br> the advantages of deep learning for feature representation and dimension\n <br> reduction. Then, it performs nonparametric clustering under a maximum margin\n <br> framework -- a discriminative clustering model and can be trained online\n <br> efficiently in the code space. Lastly model parameters are refined in the deep\n <br> belief network. Thus, this model can learn features for clustering and infer\n <br> model complexity in an unified framework. The experimental results show the\n <br> advantage of our approach over competitive baselines.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
