On target densities\n <br> where classical HMC is not an option due to intractable gradients, KMC\n <br> adaptively learns the target's gradient structure by fitting an exponential\n <br> family model in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Computational costs are\n <br> reduced by two novel efficient approximations to this gradient. While being\n <br> asymptotically exact, KMC mimics HMC in terms of sampling efficiency, and\n <br> offers substantial mixing improvements over state-of-the-art gradient free\n <br> samplers. We support our claims with experimental studies on both toy and\n <br> real-world applications, including Approximate Bayesian Computation and\n <br> exact-approximate MCMC.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
