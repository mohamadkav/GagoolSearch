{"id":675,"title":"The Metropolis—Hastings Algorithm","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274730206_The_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithm","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n This chapter is the first of a series on simulation methods based on Markov chains. However, it is a somewhat strange introduction because it contains a description of the most general algorithm of all. The next chapter (Chapter 8) concentrates on the more specific slice sampler, which then introduces the Gibbs sampler (Chapters 9 and 10), which, in turn, is a special case of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. (However, the Gibbs sampler is different in both fundamental methodology and historical motivation.)\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
