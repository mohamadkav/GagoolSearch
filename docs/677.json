Computational Stat","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246427191_Implementation_and_performance_issues_in_the_Bayesian_and_likelihood_fitting_of_multilevel_models_Computational_Stat","abstraction":"We use simulation studies (a) to compare Bayesian and likelihood fitting methods, in terms of validity of conclusions, in two-level random-slopes regression (RSR) models, and (b) to compare several Bayesian estimation methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, in terms of computational efficiency, in random-effects logistic regression (RELR) models. We find (a) that the Bayesian approach with a particular choice of diffuse inverse Wishart prior distribution for the (co)variance parameters performs at least as well-in terms of bias of estimates and actual coverage of nominal 95% intervals-as maximum likelihood methods in RSR models with medium sample sizes (expressed in terms of the number J of level-2 units), but neither approach performs as well as might be hoped wit small J; and (b) that an adaptive hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs sampling method we have developed for use in the multilevel modeling package MlwiN outperforms adaptive rejection Gibbs sampling in the RELR models we have considered, sometimes by a wide margin."}
