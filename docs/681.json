This paper discusses the use of Markov chain splitting, originally developed for the theoretical analysis of general state space Markov chains, to introduce regeneration into Markov chain samplers. This allows the use of regenerative methods for analyzing the output of these samplers, and can provide a useful diagnostic of sampler performance. The approach is applied to several samplers, including certain Metropolis samplers that can be used on their own or in hybrid samplers, and is illustrated in several examples. Key Words: Gibbs sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo, hybrid sampler, Metropolis algorithm, simulation output analysis, split chain. 1 INTRODUCTION In Markov chain Monte Carlo, a distribution ß is examined by obtaining sample paths from a Markov chain constructed to have equilibrium distribution ß.
