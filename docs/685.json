The goal of this work is to formalize and support two distinct adaptive strategies that typically accelerate the convergence of an MCMC algorithm. One approach is through resampling; the other incorporates adaptive switching of the transition kernel. Support is both by analytic arguments and simulation study. Application is envisioned in low-dimensional but nontrivial problems. Two pathological illustrations are presented. Connections with reparameterization are discussed as well as possible difficulties with infinitely often adaptation.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
