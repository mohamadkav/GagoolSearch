In such problems, many standard\n <br> Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms become arbitrary slow under the mesh refinement,\n <br> which is referred to as being dimension dependent. In this work we develop an independence sampler\n <br> based MCMC method for the infinite dimensional Bayesian inferences. We represent the proposal\n <br> distribution as a mixture of a finite number of specially parametrized Gaussian measures. We show\n <br> that under the chosen parametrization, the resulting MCMC algorithm is dimension independent.\n <br> We also design an efficient adaptive algorithm to adjust the parameter values of the mixtures from\n <br> the previous samples. Finally we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the efficiency and\n <br> robustness of the proposed method, even for problems with multimodal posterior distributions.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
