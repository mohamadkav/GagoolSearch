After discussing\n <br> specific cases from the literature, we analyse the ergodicity properties of the\n <br> resulting Markov chains. In one dimension we find that suitable choice of\n <br> $G^{-1}(x)$ can change the ergodicity properties compared to the Random Walk\n <br> Metropolis case $\\mathcal{N}(x,h\\Sigma)$, either for the better or worse. In\n <br> higher dimensions we use a specific example to show that judicious choice of\n <br> $G^{-1}(x)$ can produce a chain which will converge at a geometric rate to its\n <br> limiting distribution when probability concentrates on an ever narrower ridge\n <br> as $|x|$ grows, something which is not true for the Random Walk Metropolis.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
