We propose a novel parametrization that characterizes any\n <br> collection of non-crossing quantile planes over arbitrarily shaped convex predictor domains in any dimension by means of unconstrained scalar, vector and function valued parameters. Statistical models based on this parametrization inherit a fast computation of the likelihood function, enabling penalized likelihood or Bayesian approaches to model fitting. We introduce a complete Bayesian methodology by using Gaussian process prior distributions on the function valued parameters and develop a robust and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation. The resulting method is shown to offer posterior consistency under mild tail and regularity conditions. We present several illustrative examples where the new method is compared against existing\n <br> approaches and is found to offer better accuracy, coverage and model fit.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
