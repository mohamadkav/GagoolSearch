The algorithm is based on\n <br> a single-site updating Metropolis-Hasting sampler, the Random Database (RDB)\n <br> algorithm. Adaptive RDB (ARDB) differs from the original RDB in that the\n <br> schedule of selecting variables proposed for modification is adapted based on\n <br> the output of of the probabilistic program, rather than being fixed and\n <br> uniform. We show that ARDB still converges to the correct distribution. We\n <br> compare ARDB to RDB on several test problems highlighting different aspects of\n <br> the adaptation scheme.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
