{"id":701,"title":"Multiple design points in first and second-order reliability","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223307920_Multiple_design_points_in_first_and_second-order_reliability","abstraction":"A method is developed to successively find the multiple design points of a component reliability problem, when they exist on the limit-state surface. FORM or SORM approximations at each design point followed by a series system reliability analysis is shown to lead to improved estimates of the failure probability. Three example applications show the generality and robustness of the method."}
