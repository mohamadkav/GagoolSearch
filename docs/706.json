{"id":706,"title":"Targeted Random Sampling for Time-invariant Reliability Analysis","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283235980_Targeted_Random_Sampling_for_Time-invariant_Reliability_Analysis","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n The Targeted Random Sampling (TRS) method is extended to moderate-to-high dimensional time invariant reliability analysis. TRS is an adaptive sampling method rooted in stratified sampling variance reduction technique and represents a specific algorithm for Refined Stratified Sampling. In this work, a Markov Chain is used to sample the space densely in the vicinity of the limit stat and multi-dimensional stratum division is proposed along with a neural network based approximation of the performance function. The method is shown to perform efficiently and accurately for estimation of probability of failure for a 20 dimensional problem.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
