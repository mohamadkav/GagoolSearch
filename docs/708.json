{"id":708,"title":"A Sampling-based RBDO Algorithm with Local Refinement and Efficient Gradient Estimation","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280105735_A_Sampling-based_RBDO_Algorithm_with_Local_Refinement_and_Efficient_Gradient_Estimation","abstraction":"This article describes a two stage Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) algorithm. The first stage consists of solving an approximated RBDO problem using meta-models. In order to use gradient-based techniques, the sensitivity of failure probabilities are derived with respect to hyper-parameters of random variables as well as, and this is a novelty, deterministic variables. The second stage focuses on the local refinement of the meta-models around the first stage solution using generalized \" max-min \" samples. The approach is demonstrated on three examples including a crashworthiness problem with 11 random variables and 10 probabilistic constraints."}
