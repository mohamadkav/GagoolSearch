{"id":709,"title":"Rare Event Simulation: A Point Process Interpretation With Application In Probability And Quantile Estimation","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285310904_Rare_Event_Simulation_A_Point_Process_Interpretation_With_Application_In_Probability_And_Quantile_Estimation","abstraction":"This paper addresses the issue of estimating extreme probability and quantile on the output of complex computer codes. We introduce a new approach to this problem in term of a random walk in the output space. This allows us to derive two main results: (1) the number of samples required to get a realisation of a random variable in a given domain of probability measure p is drastically reduced, following a Poisson law with parameter log 1/p; and (2) we get parallel algorithms for estimating probabilities and quantiles and especially the optimal parallel Multilevel Splitting algorithm where there is indeed no subset to define anymore."}
