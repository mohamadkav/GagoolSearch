{"id":716,"title":"Local-Search and Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms for Pareto Optimization","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2570964_Local-Search_and_Hybrid_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Pareto_Optimization","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n In recent years, a gradual increase in the sophistication of multiobjective evolutionary algo- rithms (MOEAs) for Pareto optimization has been seen, accompanied by an ever-growing list of applications. Despite this trend, however, the proposition that methods based on local search may be a good alternative approach -- with the advantages of ease-of-use and lower computational overhead -- has not been thoroughly tested. In this thesis we develop a novel, local-sear&amp; algorithm for Pareto optimization, called PAES, enabling us to test and compare MOEAs against this philosophically different search method.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
