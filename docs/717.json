{"id":717,"title":"SMS-EMOA: multiobjective selection based on dominated hypervolume. Eur J Oper Res","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222030993_SMS-EMOA_multiobjective_selection_based_on_dominated_hypervolume_Eur_J_Oper_Res","abstraction":"The hypervolume measure (or S metric) is a frequently applied quality measure for comparing the results of evolutionary multiobjective optimisation algorithms (EMOA). The new idea is to aim explicitly for the maximisation of the dominated hypervolume within the optimisation process. A steady-state EMOA is proposed that features a selection operator based on the hypervolume measure combined with the concept of non-dominated sorting. The algorithm’s population evolves to a well-distributed set of solutions, thereby focussing on interesting regions of the Pareto front. The performance of the devised Smetric selection EMOA (SMS-EMOA) is compared to state-of-the-art methods on two- and three-objective benchmark suites as well as on aeronautical real-world applications."}
