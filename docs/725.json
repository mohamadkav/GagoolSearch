We present a suite of results concerning truncated multivariate normal distributions, some of which already appear in the mathematical literature. The focus here is to make these types of results more accessible to the environmental science community and to this end we include a conceptually simple alternative derivation of an important result. We illustrate how the theory of truncated multivariate normal distributions can be employed in the environmental sciences by means of an example from the economics of climate change control."}
