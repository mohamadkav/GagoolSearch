In particular, we wish to improve efficiency by combining expensive runs of the most complex versions of the code with relatively cheap runs from one or more simpler approximations. A Bayesian approach is described in which prior beliefs about the codes are represented in terms of Gaussian processes. An example is presented using two versions of an oil reservoir simulator.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
