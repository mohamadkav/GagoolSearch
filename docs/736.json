A wide variety of methods and\n <br> tools have been introduced for surrogate modeling aiming to develop and\n <br> utilize computationally more efficient surrogates of high-fidelity\n <br> models mostly in optimization frameworks. This paper reviews, analyzes,\n <br> and categorizes research efforts on surrogate modeling and applications\n <br> with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the water resources\n <br> field. The review analyzes 48 references on surrogate modeling arising\n <br> from water resources and also screens out more than 100 references from\n <br> the broader research community. Two broad families of surrogates namely\n <br> response surface surrogates, which are statistical or empirical\n <br> data-driven models emulating the high-fidelity model responses, and\n <br> lower-fidelity physically based surrogates, which are simplified models\n <br> of the original system, are detailed in this paper. Taxonomies on\n <br> surrogate modeling frameworks, practical details, advances, challenges,\n <br> and limitations are outlined. Important observations and some guidance\n <br> for surrogate modeling decisions are provided along with a list of\n <br> important future research directions that would benefit the common\n <br> sampling and search (optimization) analyses found in water resources.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
