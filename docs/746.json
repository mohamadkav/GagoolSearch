In this work we consider the construction of\n <br> Gaussian {process} surrogates for failure detection and failure probability\n <br> estimation. In particular, we consider the situation that the underlying\n <br> computer models are extremely expensive, and in this setting, determining the\n <br> sampling points in the state space is of essential importance. We formulate the\n <br> problem as an optimal experimental design for Bayesian inferences of the limit\n <br> state (i.e., the failure boundary) and propose an efficient numerical scheme to\n <br> solve the resulting optimization problem. In particular, the proposed\n <br> limit-state inference method is capable of determining multiple sampling points\n <br> at a time, and thus it is well suited for problems where multiple computer\n <br> simulations can be performed in parallel. The accuracy and performance of the\n <br> proposed method is demonstrated by both academic and practical examples.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
