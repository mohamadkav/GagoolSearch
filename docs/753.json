{"id":753,"title":"Comparisons of regression constants fitted by maximum likelihood to four common transformations of binomial data","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9452636_Comparisons_of_regression_constants_fitted_by_maximum_likelihood_to_four_common_transformations_of_binomial_data","abstraction":"An electronic computer was used to fit regression constants of arcsine, logit, log-log and inverse normal (probit) transforms of binomial data. The data ranged over a variety of types, biologically and mathematically, but were ‘complex’(with several independent variables). This empirical study leads one to assume, very unequivocally, that there is no practical difference in analyses using these four transformations.
