{"id":76,"title":"Virtual Interpersonal Touch and Digital Chameleons","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225766702_Virtual_Interpersonal_Touch_and_Digital_Chameleons","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n We studied the characteristics of hand touch with a mechanical device that approximated a handshake, and we then examined\n <br> the effect of handshake mimicry on assessment of a partner. Two participants interacted with a force-feedback joystick that\n <br> recorded each of their hand movements individually. The two participants then greeted one another by feeling the recording\n <br> of the other person’s movements via the force-feedback device. For each dyad, one of the participants actually received his\n <br> or her own virtual handshake back under the guise that it was the other person’s virtual handshake. Results demonstrated three\n <br> significant findings. First, for any given participant, a metric that took into account position, angle, speed, and acceleration\n <br> of the hand movements correlated highly within individuals across two handshakes. Second, across participants, these metrics\n <br> demonstrated specific differences by gender. Finally, there was an interaction between gender and mimicry, such that male\n <br> participants liked people who mimicked their handshakes more than female participants did. We discuss the implications of\n <br> these findings and relate them to theories of social interaction.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
