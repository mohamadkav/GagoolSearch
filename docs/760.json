The foveal and peripheral compartments of the visual field are differentially sensitive to parts of the spatial frequency spectrum. In two experiments, we investigated how the selective attenuation of spatial frequencies in the central or the peripheral affects eye-movement behavior during real-world scene viewing. Gaze-contingent low-pass or high-pass filters with varying filter cutoffs (Experiment 1) or filter size (Experiment 2) were applied. Compared with unfiltered control conditions, mean fixation durations increased more with central high-pass and peripheral low-pass filtering than with central low-pass and peripheral high-pass filtering. Increasing filter size and filter level progressively increased fixation durations in half of the conditions, but had no effect with the other conditions. The effects suggest that fixation durations prolong with increasing processing difficulty as long as the available information is useful. When fixation durations were unaffected by increasing processing difficulty, saccade amplitudes were modulated instead, indicating a trade-off between saccade timing and saccadic selection. Taken together, interactions of perception and gaze control are compatible with a perceptual economy account."}
