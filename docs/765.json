{"id":765,"title":"Efficient Monte Carlo simulation via the generalized splitting method","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220286431_Efficient_Monte_Carlo_simulation_via_the_generalized_splitting_method","abstraction":"We describe a new Monte Carlo algorithm for the consistent and unbiased estimation of multidimensional integrals and the efficient sampling from multidimensional densities. The algorithm is inspired by the classical splitting method and can be applied to general static simulation models. We provide examples from rare-event probability estimation, counting, and sampling, demonstrating that the proposed method can outperform existing Markov chain sampling methods in terms of convergence speed and accuracy."}
