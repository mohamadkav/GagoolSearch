The main reason is that the likelihood ratio in the importance sampling estimator degenerates\n <br> when the dimension of the problem becomes large. Various remedies to this problem have been suggested, including heuristics\n <br> such as resampling. Even so, the consensus is that for large-dimensional problems, likelihood ratios (and hence importance\n <br> sampling) should be avoided. In this paper we introduce a new adaptive simulation approach that does away with likelihood\n <br> ratios, while retaining the multi-level approach of the cross-entropy method. Like the latter, the method can be used for\n <br> rare-event probability estimation, optimization, and counting. Moreover, the method allows one to sample exactly from the\n <br> target distribution rather than asymptotically as in Markov chain Monte Carlo. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness\n <br> of the method for a variety of applications.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
