Our goal is to automatically de- tect the state of a meeting and the role of each meeting participant and to do so concurrent with a meeting. We trained a decision tree classifier that learns to detect these states and roles from simple speech-based features that are easy to compute automatically. This classifier detects meeting states 18% absolute more accurately than a ran- dom classifier , and detects participant roles 10% absolute more accurately than a majority classifier . The results im- ply that simple, easy to compute features can be used for this purpose.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
