Each user is assigned a fingerprint which is a word in a fingerprinting code of size M (the total number of users) and length n. We present binary fingerprinting codes secure against size-t coalitions which enable the distributor (decoder) to recover at least one of the users from the coalition with probability of error exp(-?(n)) for M=exp(?(n)). This is an improvement over the best known schemes that provide the error probability no better than exp(-?(n\n <sup>1</sup>2/)) and for this probability support at most exp(O(n\n <sup>1</sup>2/)) users. The construction complexity of codes is polynomial in n. We also present versions of these constructions that afford identification algorithms of complexity poly(n)=polylog(M), improving over the best previously known complexity of ?(M). For the case t=2, we construct codes of exponential size with even stronger performance, namely, for which the distributor can either recover both users from the coalition with probability 1-exp(?(n)), or identify one traitor with probability 1.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
