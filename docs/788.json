Parallel genetic algorithm for search and constrained multiobjective optimization introduces the design and complexity analysis of a parallel genetic algorithm to generate a \"best\" path for a robot arm to follow, given a starting position and a goal in three dimensional space. Path generation takes into account any obstacles near the arm. This algorithm uses multiple optimization criteria, independent cross-pollinating populations, and handles multiple hard constraints. Individuals in the population consist of multiple chromosomes. The complexity of the algorithm is the number of generations processed times O(N ) where N is the total number of individuals used for path generation on all of the optimizations.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
