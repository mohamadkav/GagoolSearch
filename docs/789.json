This paper describes a GA based approach to solve variable geometry optimization problems where (a) the connectivity requirement cannot be easily specified or tested, (b) the space of configurations is made up of multiple disconnected spaces, thus making it likely that a GA would find sets of configurations that are not connected and (c) the cost of testing for connectivity, while examining each pair of configurations, is prohibitive. The approach has been tested and evaluated on a problem from computational biology, modeling the bones of a snake jaw.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
