{"id":794,"title":"Corrected Kriging Update Formulae for Batch-Sequential Data Assimilation","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221966156_Corrected_Kriging_Update_Formulae_for_Batch-Sequential_Data_Assimilation","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Recently, a lot of effort has been paid to the efficient computation of\n <br> Kriging predictors when observations are assimilated sequentially. In\n <br> particular, Kriging update formulae enabling significant computational savings\n <br> were derived in Barnes and Watson (1992), Gao et al. (1996), and Emery (2009).\n <br> Taking advantage of the previous Kriging mean and variance calculations helps\n <br> avoiding a costly $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ matrix inversion when adding one\n <br> observation to the $n$ already available ones. In addition to traditional\n <br> update formulae taking into account a single new observation, Emery (2009) also\n <br> proposed formulae for the batch-sequential case, i.e. when $r &gt; 1$ new\n <br> observations are simultaneously assimilated. However, the Kriging variance and\n <br> covariance formulae given without proof in Emery (2009) for the\n <br> batch-sequential case are not correct. In this paper we fix this issue and\n <br> establish corrected expressions for updated Kriging variances and covariances\n <br> when assimilating several observations in parallel.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
