{"id":796,"title":"Finding Near-Optimal Bayesian Experimental Designs via Genetic Algorithms","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4750207_Finding_Near-Optimal_Bayesian_Experimental_Designs_via_Genetic_Algorithms","abstraction":"This article shows how a genetic algorithm can be used to find near-optimal Bayesian experimental designs for regression models. The design criterion considered is the expected Shannon information gain of the posterior distribution obtained from performing a given experiment compared with the prior distribution. Genetic algorithms are described and then applied to experimental designs. The methodology is then illustrated with a wide range of examples: linear and nonlinear regression, single and multiple factors, and normal and Bernoulli distributed experimental data."}
