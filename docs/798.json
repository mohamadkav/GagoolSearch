Eng. Mech., 2001) has become one of the most\n <br> popular method to solve it. Subset simulation has been shown to provide\n <br> significant savings in the number of simulations to achieve a given accuracy of\n <br> estimation, with respect to many other Monte Carlo approaches. The number of\n <br> simulations remains still quite high however, and this method can be\n <br> impractical for applications where an expensive-to-evaluate computer model is\n <br> involved. We propose a new algorithm, called Bayesian Subset Simulation, that\n <br> takes the best from the Subset Simulation algorithm and from sequential\n <br> Bayesian methods based on kriging (also known as Gaussian process modeling).\n <br> The performance of this new algorithm is illustrated using a test case from the\n <br> literature. We are able to report promising results. In addition, we provide a\n <br> numerical study of the statistical properties of the estimator.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
