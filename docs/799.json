While a computer simulator can often be viewed as an inexpensive way to gain insight into a system, it can still be computationally costly. Much of the recent work on the design and anal-ysis of computer experiments has focused on scenarios where the goal is to fit a response surface or process optimization. In this article, we develop sequential methodology for estimating a contour from a complex computer code. The approach uses a stochastic process model as a surrogate for the computer simulator. The surrogate model and associated uncertainty are key components in a new criterion used to identify the computer trials aimed specifically at improv-ing the contour estimate. The proposed approach is applied to exploration of a contour for a network queuing system. Issues related to practical implementation of the proposed approach are also addressed.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
