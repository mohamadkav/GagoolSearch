Previous works on the same corpus demonstrated a high recognition accuracy using SVMs with RBF kernels. In this paper, we discuss the problems of that approach, mainly over-fitting, the curse of dimensionality and the inability to generalize to different group configurations. We present results obtained with an influence modeling method that avoid these problems and ensures both greater robustness and generalization capability.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
