However, when several (competing) objectives are\n <br> considered, choosing an appropriate sampling strategy remains an open question.\n <br> We present here a new algorithm based on stepwise uncertainty reduction\n <br> principles to address this issue. Optimization is seen as a sequential\n <br> reduction of the volume of the excursion sets below the current best solutions,\n <br> and our sampling strategy chooses the points that give the highest expected\n <br> reduction. Closed-form formulae are provided to compute the sampling criterion,\n <br> avoiding the use of cumbersome simulations. We test our method on numerical\n <br> examples, showing that it provides an efficient trade-off between exploration\n <br> and intensification.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
