A novel area of multi-modal data labelling, which has received relatively little attention, is the automatic estimation of the most dominant person in a group meeting. In this paper, we provide a framework for detecting dominance in group meetings using different audio and video cues. We show that by using a simple model for dominance estimation we can obtain promising results.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
