The primary contribution of this paper is to nullify the disadvantages of traditional probabilistic topic models on pixel-level supervised information and to achieve the effective classification of VHR remote sensing images. This framework consists of the following two iterative steps. In the training stage, the model utilizes the central labeled pixel and its neighborhood, as a squared labeled image object, to train the classifiers. In the classification stage, each central unlabeled pixel with its neighborhood, as an unlabeled object, is classified as a user-provided geoobject class label with the maximum posterior probability. Gibbs sampling is adopted for model inference. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms two classical SVM-based supervised classification methods and probabilistic-topic-models-based classification methods."}
