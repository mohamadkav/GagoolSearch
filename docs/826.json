Managing large scale multimedia data with correct tags and annotations is very important task. Incorrect tags and annotations make it hard to manage multimedia data. Accurate tags and annotation ease management of multimedia data and give high quality retrieve results. Fully manual image tagging which is tagged by user will be most accurate tags when the user tags correct information. Nevertheless, most of users do not make effort on task of tagging. Therefore, we suffer from lots of noisy tags. Best solution for accurate image tagging is to tag image automatically. Robust automatic image tagging models are proposed by many researchers and it is still most interesting research field these days. Since there are still lots of limitations in automatic image tagging models, we propose efficient automatic image tagging model using multigrid based image segmentation and feature extraction method. Our model can improve the object descriptions of images and image regions. Our method is tested with Corel dataset and the result showed that our model performance is efficient and effective compared to other models."}
