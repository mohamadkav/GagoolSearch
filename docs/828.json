In\n <br> other words, information retrieval techniques will be exploited based on the\n <br> textual similarity between queries and textual representation of software\n <br> artifacts, which is generated by collecting words from comments, identifiers,\n <br> and descriptions of programs. However, in addition to these semantic\n <br> information, there are rich information embedded in source codes themselves.\n <br> These source codes, if analyzed properly, can be a rich source for enhancing\n <br> the efforts of software artifact retrieval. To this end, in this paper, we\n <br> develop a feature extraction method on source codes. Specifically, this method\n <br> can capture both the inherent information in the source codes and the semantic\n <br> information hidden in the comments, descriptions, and identifiers of the source\n <br> codes. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous metric learning approach, which\n <br> allows to integrate code features and text features into the same latent\n <br> semantic space. This, in turn, can help to measure the artifact similarity by\n <br> exploiting the joint power of both code and text features. Finally, extensive\n <br> experiments on real-world data show that the proposed method can help to\n <br> improve the performances of software artifact retrieval with a significant\n <br> margin.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
