There exists various kinds of human laugh signal, for example:\n <br> vocalized laugh and non vocalized laugh. Following the theories of psychology,\n <br> among all the vocalized laugh type, rhythmic staccato-vocalization\n <br> significantly evokes the positive responses in the interactions. In this paper\n <br> we attempt to exploit this observation to detect human laugh occurrences, i.e.,\n <br> the laughter, in multiparty conversations from the AMI meeting corpus. First,\n <br> we separate the high energy frames from speech, leaving out the low energy\n <br> frames through power spectral density estimation. We borrow the algorithm of\n <br> rhythm detection from the area of music analysis to use that on the high energy\n <br> frames. Finally, we detect rhythmic laugh frames, analyzing the candidate\n <br> rhythmic frames using statistics. This novel approach for detection of\n <br> `positive' rhythmic human laughter performs better than the standard laughter\n <br> classification baseline.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
