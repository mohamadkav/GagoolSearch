An approach to smoothing and forecasting for time series with missing observations is proposed. For an underlying state-space model, the EM algorithm is used in conjunction with the conventional Kalman smoothed estimators to derive a simple recursive procedure for estimating the parameters by maximum likelihood. An example is given which involves smoothing and forecasting an economic series using the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
