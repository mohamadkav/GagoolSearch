Not only the common\n <br> tensor factorization models but also any arbitrary tensor factorization\n <br> structure can be realized by the PLTF framework. This paper presents full\n <br> Bayesian inference via variational Bayes that facilitates more powerful\n <br> modelling and allows more sophisticated inference on the PLTF framework. We\n <br> illustrate our approach on model order selection and link prediction.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
