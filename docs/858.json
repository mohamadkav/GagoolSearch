There is a large\n <br> body of work on it, but there does not exist any work that formulates the\n <br> problem in a structured output setting. Also, most applications have\n <br> constraints on the imputed data, for example on the distribution associated\n <br> with each variable. None of the existing imputation methods use these\n <br> constraints. In this paper we propose a structured output approach for missing\n <br> value imputation that also incorporates domain constraints. We focus on large\n <br> margin models, but it is easy to extend the ideas to probabilistic models. We\n <br> deal with the intractable inference step in learning via a piecewise training\n <br> technique that is simple, efficient, and effective. Comparison with existing\n <br> state-of-the-art and baseline imputation methods shows that our method gives\n <br> significantly improved performance on the Hamming loss measure.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
