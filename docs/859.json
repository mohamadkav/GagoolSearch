{"id":859,"title":"Applying Discrete PCA in Data Analysis","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229157546_Applying_Discrete_PCA_in_Data_Analysis","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Methods for analysis of principal components in discrete data have existed\n <br> for some time under various names such as grade of membership modelling,\n <br> probabilistic latent semantic analysis, and genotype inference with admixture.\n <br> In this paper we explore a number of extensions to the common theory, and\n <br> present some application of these methods to some common statistical tasks. We\n <br> show that these methods can be interpreted as a discrete version of ICA. We\n <br> develop a hierarchical version yielding components at different levels of\n <br> detail, and additional techniques for Gibbs sampling. We compare the algorithms\n <br> on a text prediction task using support vector machines, and to information\n <br> retrieval.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
