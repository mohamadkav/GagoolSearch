Conventional clustering techniques, however, are designed to only provide a single grouping or clustering of a dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called CAMI, that can un- cover alternative clusterings from a dataset. CAMI takes a mathematically appealing approach, combining the use of mutual information to distinguish between alternative clus- terings, coupled with an expectation maximization frame- work to ensure clustering quality. We experimentally test CAMI on both synthetic and real-world datasets, compar- ing it against a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms. We demonstrate that CAMI's performance is high and that its formulation provides a number of advantages compared to existing techniques.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
