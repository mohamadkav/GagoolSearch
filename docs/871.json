Similarly, feature selection for clustering tries to find one feature subset where one interesting clustering solution resides. However, a single data set may be multi-faceted and can be grouped and in-terpreted in many different ways, especially for high dimensional data, where feature selection is typically needed. Moreover, differ-ent clustering solutions are interesting for different purposes. In-stead of committing to one clustering solution, in this paper we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric Bayesian model that can discover several possible clustering solutions and the feature subset views that generated each cluster partitioning simultaneously. We provide a variational inference approach to learn the features and clustering partitions in each view. Our model allows us not only to learn the multiple clusterings and views but also allows us to auto-matically learn the number of views and the number of clusters in each view.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
