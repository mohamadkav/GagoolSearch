As a preprocessing step, we propose to identify a\n <br> hop-free subset of data by discarding high-entropy spectral slices from\n <br> the spectrogram. High-resolution localization is then achieved via\n <br> either quadrilinear regression of four-way data generated by\n <br> capitalizing on both spatial and temporal shift invariance or a new\n <br> maximum likelihood (ML)-based two-dimensional (2-D) harmonic retrieval\n <br> algorithm. The latter option achieves the best-known model\n <br> identifiability bound while remaining close to the Cramer-Rao bound even\n <br> at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Following beamforming using the\n <br> recovered directions, a dynamic programming approach is developed for\n <br> joint ML estimation of signal frequencies and hop instants in\n <br> single-user tracking. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is\n <br> illustrated in pertinent simulations\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
