The problem is formulated in a probabilistic model and an auto-calibration sparse Bayesian learning algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, signal and perturbation are iteratively estimated to achieve sparsity by leveraging a variational Bayesian expectation maximization technique. Results from numerical experiments have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm has achieved improvements on the accuracy of signal reconstruction.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
