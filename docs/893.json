{"id":893,"title":"Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such \"autoencoder\" networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
