{"id":898,"title":"Ferguson Distributions Via Polya Urn Schemes","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357646_Ferguson_Distributions_Via_Polya_Urn_Schemes","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n The Polya urn scheme is extended by allowing a continuum of colors. For the extended scheme, the distribution of colors after $n$ draws is shown to converge as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ to a limiting discrete distribution $\\mu^\\ast$. The distribution of $\\mu^\\ast$ is shown to be one introduced by Ferguson and, given $\\mu^\\ast$, the colors drawn from the urn are shown to be independent with distribution $\\mu^\\ast$.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
