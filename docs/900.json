It is shown that the covariance ma- trices from the variational Bayes approxima- tions are normally 'too small' compared with those for the maximum likelihood estimator, so that resulting interval estimates for the pa- rameters will be unrealistically narrow, espe- cially if the components of the mixture model are not well separated."}
