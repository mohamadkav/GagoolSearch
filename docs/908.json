Our key innovation is to represent the pattern of links between records\n <br> as a {\\em bipartite} graph, in which records are directly linked to latent true\n <br> individuals, and only indirectly linked to other records. This flexible new\n <br> representation of the linkage structure naturally allows us to estimate the\n <br> attributes of the unique observable people in the population, calculate $k$-way\n <br> posterior probabilities of matches across records, and propagate the\n <br> uncertainty of record linkage into later analyses. Our linkage structure lends\n <br> itself to an efficient, linear-time, hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm,\n <br> which overcomes many obstacles encountered by previously proposed methods of\n <br> record linkage, despite the high dimensional parameter space. We assess our\n <br> results on real and simulated data.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
