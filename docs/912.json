{"id":912,"title":"Optimal sensor placement and motion coordination for target tracking","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222579717_Optimal_sensor_placement_and_motion_coordination_for_target_tracking","abstraction":"This work studies optimal sensor placement and motion coordination strategies for mobile sensor networks. For a target-tracking application with range sensors, we investigate the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix and compute it in the 2D and 3D cases, characterizing the global minima in the 2D case. We propose motion coordination algorithms that steer the mobile sensor network to an optimal deployment and that are amenable to a decentralized implementation. Finally, our numerical simulations illustrate how the proposed algorithms lead to improved performance of an extended Kalman filter in a target-tracking scenario."}
