A combined kinematic/torque control law is developed using backstepping, and asymptotic stability is guaranteed by Lyapunov theory. Moreover, this control algorithm can be applied to the three basic nonholonomic navigation problems: tracking a reference trajectory, path following, and stabilization about a desired posture. The result is a general structure for controlling a mobile robot that can accommodate different control techniques, rang-ing from a conventional computed-torque controller, when all dynamics are known, to robust-adaptive controllers if this is not the case. A robust-adaptive controller based on neural networks (NNs) is proposed in this work. The NN controller can deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and/or unstructured unmodeled dynamics in the vehicle. On-line NN weight tuning algorithms that do not require off-line learning yet guarantee small tracking errors and bounded control signals are utilized."}
