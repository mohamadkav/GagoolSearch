The codebook\n <br> approach describes an image as a bag of discrete visual codewords, where the frequency distributions of these words are used\n <br> for image categorization. There are two drawbacks to the traditional codebook model: codeword uncertainty and codeword plausibility.\n <br> Both of these drawbacks stem from the hard assignment of visual features to a single codeword. We show that allowing a degree\n <br> of ambiguity in assigning codewords improves categorization performance for three state-of-the-art datasets.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
