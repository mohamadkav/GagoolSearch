{"id":938,"title":"Joint dictionary learning and topic modeling for image clustering","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224246065_Joint_dictionary_learning_and_topic_modeling_for_image_clustering","abstraction":"A new Bayesian model is proposed, integrating dictionary learning and topic modeling into a unified framework. The model is applied to cluster multiple images, and a subset of the images may be annotated. Example results are presented on the MNIST digit data and on the Microsoft MSRC multi-scene image data. These results reveal the working mechanisms of the model and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance."}
