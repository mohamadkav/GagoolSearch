Preprocessing was performed by a ?-nearest-neighbor pdf estimation scheme, although other methods are suggested in this paper. The procedure was studied experimentally and was found to achieve a significant reduction in the storage requirements of the CNN method while maintaining approximately the same error rate, or even improving it."}
