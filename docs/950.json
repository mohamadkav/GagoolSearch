The ap- proach is novel in that it jointly considers both previous re- sults on photo quality and beauty assessment, as well as it incorporates non-permanent facial characteristics and expres- sions in the context of female facial aesthetics. This study helps us understand the role of this specific set of features in affecting the way humans perceive facial images. Based on the above objective parameters, we further con- struct a simple linear metric that hints modifiable parameters for aesthetics enhancement, as well as tunes soft biometric systems that would seek to predict the way humans perceive facial aesthetics."}
