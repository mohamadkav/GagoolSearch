Accordingly, in this paper we present results of experiments to evaluate the extent of universal beauty. The experiments were performed by asking a number of diverse human referees to grade a same collection of female face images. These grades were later compared to the results obtained from an automated classifier. Results obtained prove that the classifier is able to reproduce the human judgment reliably and could be used as an automated tool for objective classification of female facial beauty."}
