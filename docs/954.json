{"id":954,"title":"Pattern &amp; Growth in Personality","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232461648_Pattern_Growth_in_Personality","abstraction":"A revision of the author's 1937 publication, \"Personality: A Psychological Interpretation\" (see  11: 1964). The most important recent \"fruits of personological research\" are surveyed. Intended for \"college students who have little or no background in psychology,\" this edition incorporates a restatement of Allport's thesis that man is not a reactive robot but a being with unique potential for growth and a revision of his argument regarding functional autonomy. New chapters dealing with cultural factors in personality, cognition, the self, learning, personality assessment, and person perception are included. The philosophical consequences of endorsing one psychological interpretation of personality rather than another are discussed. From Psyc Abstracts 36:01:3HA93A.
