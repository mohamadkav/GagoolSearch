{"id":956,"title":"The Varieties of Human Physique","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232471427_The_Varieties_of_Human_Physique","abstraction":"Based on a detailed study of frontal, dorsal and lateral photographs of 4000 male subjects of college age, a 3 dimensional scheme for describing human physique is formulated. Kretschmer's constitutional typology is discarded in favor of one based on 3 first order variables or components, endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy, each of which is found in an individual physique and indicated by one of a set of 3 numerals designating a somatotype or patterning of these morphological components. Seventy-six different somatotypes are described and illustrated. These somatotypical designations are objectively assigned on the basis of the use of 18 anthropometric indices. Second-order variables also isolated and studied are dysplasia, gynandromorphy, texture and hirsutism. Historical trends in constitutional research are summarized. A detailed description is given of the development of the somatotyping technique combining anthroposcopic and anthropometric methods. Reference is made to somatotyping with the aid of a specially devised machine. Topics discussed include: the choice of variables, morphological scales, a geometrical representation of somatotypes, the independence of components, correlational data, the problem of norms, the modifiability of a somatotype, hereditary and endocrine influences and the relation of constitution to temperament, mental disease, clinical studies, crime and delinquency, and the differential education of children. Descriptive sketches of variants of the ectomorphic components are given. Appendices list tables for somatotyping and a series of drawings of 9 female somatotypes. An annotated bibliography is followed by a more general one. 272 photographs and drawings illustrate the somatotypes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"}
