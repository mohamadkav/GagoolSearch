This paper explores the influence of two variables on the outcomes of such negotiations: the mobility of negotiators and the frame of the short-term sacrifice required to reach long-term gain. Specifically, we focus on the integrativeness of agreements both within a static negotiating period as well as across several negotiations. Subjects participated in an experiment that consisted of 10 similar negotiations across time, with two issues being addressed in each negotiation. The experiment was created to allow for the possibility of a moderately advantageous integrative agreement within each static negotiation, as well as a superior integrative agreement across negotiations. A higher level of negotiator mobility was predicted to decrease the integrativeness of outcomes across negotiations. This prediction was supported. The frame of the sacrifice required of subjects was predicted to affect integrativeness both within as well as across negotiations, such that subjects would be less likely to sacrifice on an issue, or issues, if it meant accepting a perceived loss rather than a reduced gain. This prediction was not supported. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for managerial negotiation and decision making."}
