{"id":979,"title":"Social Signal Processing: Understanding social interactions through nonverbal behavior analysis (PDF)","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228930411_Social_Signal_Processing_Understanding_social_interactions_through_nonverbal_behavior_analysis_PDF","abstraction":"This paper introduces Social Signal Processing (SSP), the domain aimed at automatic understanding of social interactions through analysis of nonverbal behavior. The core idea of SSP is that nonverbal behavior is machine de-tectable evidence of social signals, the relational attitudes exchanged between interacting individuals. Social signals include (dis-)agreement, empathy, hostility, and any other attitude towards others that is expressed not only by words but by nonverbal behaviors such as facial expression and body posture as well. Thus, nonverbal behavior analysis is used as a key to automatic understanding of social interac-tions. This paper presents not only a survey of the related literature and the main concepts underlying SSP, but also an illustrative example of how such concepts are applied to the analysis of conflicts in competitive discussions."}
