We apply this scheme to solve a specific image processing\n <br> problem: urban areas detection in satellite images. First we propose to\n <br> analyze the texture through the modelling of the luminance field with eight\n <br> different chain-based models. We then derived a texture parameter from these\n <br> models. The effect of the lattice anisotropy is corrected by a renormalization\n <br> group technique coming from statistical physics. This parameter, which takes\n <br> into account local conditional variances of the image, is compared to classical\n <br> methods of texture analysis. Afterwards we develop a modified fuzzy Cmeans\n <br> algorithm that includes an entropy term. The advantage of such an algorithm\n <br> is that the number of classes does not need to be known a priori. Besides\n <br> this algorithm provides us with further information, i.e. the probability\n <br> that a given pixel belongs to a given cluster. Finally we introduce this\n <br> information in a Markovian model of segmentation. Some results on SPOT5\n <br> simulated images, SPOT3 images and ERS1 radar images are presented. These\n <br> images are provided by the French National Space Agency (CNES) and\n <br> the European Space Agency (ESA).\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
