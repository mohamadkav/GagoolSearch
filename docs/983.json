{"id":983,"title":"ANVIL - A Generic Annotation Tool for Multimodal Dialogue","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221487883_ANVIL_-_A_Generic_Annotation_Tool_for_Multimodal_Dialogue","abstraction":"Anvil is a tool for the annotation of audiovisual material con- taining multimodal dialogue. Annotation takes place on freely definable, multiple layers (tracks) by inserting time-anchored elements that hold a number of typed attribute-value pairs. Higher-level elements (suprasegmental) consist of a sequence of elements. Attributes contain symbols or cross-level links to arbitrary other elements. Anvil is highly generic (usable with different annotation schemes), platform-independent, XML- based and fitted with an intuitive graphical user interface. For project integration, Anvil offers the import of speech transcrip- tion and export of text and table data for further statistical pro- cessing."}
