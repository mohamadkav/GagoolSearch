{"id":986,"title":"Towards a Technology of Nonverbal Communication: Vocal Behavior in Social and Affective Phenomena","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47508039_Towards_a_Technology_of_Nonverbal_Communication_Vocal_Behavior_in_Social_and_Affective_Phenomena","abstraction":"Nonverbal communication is the main channel through which we experience inner life of others, including their emotions, feelings, moods, social attitudes, etc. This attracts the interest of the computing community because nonverbal communication is based on cues like facial expressions, vocalizations, gestures, postures, etc. that we can perceive with our senses and can be (and often are) detected, analyzed and synthesized with automatic approaches. In other words, nonverbal communication can be used as a viable interface between computers and some of the most important aspects of human psychology such as emotions and social attitudes. As a result, a new computing domain seems to emerge that we can define “technology of nonverbal communication”. This chapter outlines some of the most salient aspects of such a potentially new domain and outlines some of its most important perspectives for the future."}
