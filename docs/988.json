An understanding of the face-to-face communications in a group discussion can provide new clues about how humans collaborate to accomplish complex tasks and how the collaboration protocols can be learned. It can also help us to evaluate and facilitate brainstorming sessions. We will discuss the following three findings about the dynamics: Meet- ings in dierent languages and on dierent topics could follow the same form of dynamics; The functional roles of the meeting participants could be better understood by inspecting not only their individual speaking and activity features but also their interactions with each other; The outcome of a meeting could be predicted by inspecting how its participants interact."}
