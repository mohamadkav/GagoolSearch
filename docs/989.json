In this respect, social roles are a key aspect of social interaction because they are the basis for making reasonable guesses about human behavior. Recognizing roles is a crucial need towards understanding (possibly in an automatic way) any social exchange, whether this means to identify dominant individuals, detect conflict, assess engagement or spot conversation highlights. This work presents an investigation on language-independent automatic social role recognition in AMI meetings, spontaneous multi-party conversations, based solely on turn organization and prosodic features. At first turn-taking statistics and prosodic features are integrated into a single generative conversation model which achieves an accuracy of 59%. This model is then extended to explicitly account for dependencies (or influence) between speakers achieving an accuracy of 65%. The last contribution consists in investigating the statistical dependency between the formal and the social role that participants have; integrating the information related to the formal role in the recognition model achieves an accuracy of 68%. The paper is concluded highlighting some future directions.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
