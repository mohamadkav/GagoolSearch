{"id":99,"title":"Estimation of Parameters in Hidden Markov Models","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259014834_Estimation_of_Parameters_in_Hidden_Markov_Models","abstraction":"<p itemprop=\"description\"> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong> </p>\n<div>\n Parameter estimation from noisy versions of realizations of Markov\n <br> models is extremely difficult in all but very simple examples. The paper\n <br> identifies these difficulties, reviews ways of coping with them in\n <br> practice, and discusses in detail a class of methods with a Monte Carlo\n <br> flavour. Their performance on simple examples suggests that they should\n <br> be valuable, practically feasible procedures in the context of a range\n <br> of otherwise intractable problems. An illustration is provided based on\n <br> satellite data.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
