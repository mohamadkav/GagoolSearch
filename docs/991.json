Reversely this work investigates the use of social signals to improve conventional speech processing methods. In details we propose the use of turn-taking patterns induced by roles for improving speaker diarization, the task of determining 'Who spoke when' in an audio file. In detail, this work studies how to include this information as statistical prior on the speaker interactions for segmenting and clustering speakers in multi-party political debates. Experiments reveal that the proposed approach reduces the speaker error over the baseline by 25% when both the number of speakers and their roles are known and by 13% relative when the pattern information is estimated from the data. Furthermore we never verify a performance degradation in any recording. Experiments are also carried out to investigate the contribution of the first-order Markov assumption i.e. that the role of the speaker n is conditionally dependent on the role of the speaker n-1.\n</div> \n<p></p>"}
