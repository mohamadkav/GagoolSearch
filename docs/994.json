Weproposea new approach that takes into account speech from other talkers, relying only on speech/non-speech information from all partic- ipants. We find (1) that modeling other participants improves DA detection, even in the absence of other information, (2) that only the single locally most talkative other participant mat- ters, and (3) that 10 seconds provides a sufficiently large local context. Results further show significant performance improve- ments over a lexical-only system — particularly for the DAs of interest. We conclude that interaction-based modeling at turn edges can be achieved by relatively simple features and should be incorporated for improved meeting understanding.
